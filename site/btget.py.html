Azureus is a pretty nice way to download torrents, but I tend to put it off in another workpsace and forget about it.  I thought it would be cool if I could reliably script a bittorrent download on the command line so that when it finished, some other scripted action(s) would happen (for example, send the file off somewhere else).

btdownloadheadless is perfect for this task.  All you need to do is kill it once you get to 100% success.  I thought that maybe I could get away with a simple shell command, like this:

<pre class="sh"><code>btdownloadheadless foo.torrent | tee output.txt | grep -iq "download succeeded"</code></pre>

... but grep exits, giving tee a broken pipe but not killing it, and btdownloadheadless keeps running.

Plus, btdownloadheadless is really stubborn about getting killed by SIGINT or SIGTERM -- you usually need to SIGKILL it.

So I wrote a little Python script to do this.

<pre class="python"><code>import sys, os, signal, subprocess, time

def kill_with_prejudice(pid):
    #btdownloadheadless isn't usually very responsive to SIGINT or SIGTERM
    for i in range(10):
        try:
            os.kill(p.pid, signal.SIGTERM)
        except:
            return
        else:
            time.sleep(0.1)
    try:
        os.kill(p.pid, signal.SIGKILL)
    except:
        pass

p = None

try:
    p = subprocess.Popen(["btdownloadheadless", sys.argv[1]], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

    # can't iterate over p.stdout without destroying responsiveness -- some
    # sort of buffering?  xreadlines is the same.  instead, we settle for
    # calling readline() over and over.
    while 1:
        line = p.stdout.readline()
        if line.startswith('percent done:'):
            if line.split()[-1] == '100':
                kill_with_prejudice(p.pid)
                print "%s: download complete.  exiting." % sys.argv[0]
                raise SystemExit

        print line,

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    if p:
        kill_with_prejudice(p.pid)
    raise SystemExit</code></pre>

You run it like this:

<pre class="sh"><code>python btget.py foo.torrent</code></pre>

It will look just like btdownloadheadless except it'll exit when 100% is reached.

Todo: wait until X amount of additional good-citizen seeding has been done before exiting.
