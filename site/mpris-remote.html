mpris-remote is a utility that controls an <a
    href="http://mpris.org/">MPRIS</a>-capable music player.

Supported players include:

<ul>
<li>Audacious</li>
<li>VLC (must launch with <code>vlc --control dbus</code>)</li>
<li>BMPx</li>
<li>QMMP</li>
<li>XMMS2 via <a href="http://github.com/caotic/xmms2-mpris-bridge/tree/master">xmms2-mpris-bridge</a></li>
<li>MPD via <a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:MpDris">mpDris</a></li>
<li>Dragon Player</li>
<li><a href="corn.html">Corn</a> (written by me)</li>
</ul>

The level of MPRIS compliance varies wildly between these different players,
but mpris-remote tries to work around that as much as possible.  Some players
don't report status information, some don't support metadata, etc.

Code is at <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/mpris-remote/tree/master">github</a>.  It's a
Python script and doesn't require any building or installation.  Just put it
somewhere in your PATH.  It does depend on the Python D-BUS module.

<pre class="sh"><code>git clone git://github.com/mackstann/mpris-remote.git</code></pre>

The usage text is hopefully pretty self-explanatory.  Use <code>-h</code> or
<code>--help</code> to read it.

<h3>examples</h3>

<pre class="sh"><code>
$ mpris-remote clear
$ mpris-remote random true
$ mpris-remote loop true
$ find ~/music -name '*.mp3' | mpris-remote addtrack -
$ mpris-remote play</code></pre>
