<h1>What's the diff?</h1>

<h2>With viewports, aka large desktops:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your desktop is bigger than what you see at any given time.</li>
<li>The viewport is the screen-size piece of desktop you are currently
viewing.</li>
<li>You can move around within this bigger desktop in screen-size increments
(the norm).  You can also smoothly scroll around it, but few WMs support this
and few people do it (or want it, I assume).</li>
<li>If a window is hanging off the edge of one viewport, its non-visible
portion will be visible in the next viewport.</li>
<li>You can "stick" a window (as in, "stuck to the monitor glass") so that it
remains in the same position regardless of viewport movements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>With virtual desktops, aka workspaces:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each workspace acts as an independent screen with its own set of contained
windows.</li>
<li>A window can be designated to show up on multiple workspaces, and/or sent
around from one workspace to another, usually via a menu option such as "send
to desktop 3".</li>
<li>Windows do not overlap between workspaces as they do with viewports</li>
<li>Workspaces are generally not very spatially oriented, rather they tend to
have names or numbers, and are presented as a list.</li>
</ul>

These descriptions may be a little biased in favor of viewports, since I prefer
them.  See <a href="why-viewports-rule.html">why viewports rule</a>.

<h2>Other explanations</h2>

<em>A Viewport is a partial view of a virtual Desktop. Kahakai not only lets
you have virtual desktops (to give you the effect of having a bigger screen),
it lets you have multiple Desktops, as if you had multiple physical
screens.</em> -- From <a
