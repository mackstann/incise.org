<h1>Recovering keyboard and mouse input in X11</h1>

Once upon a time, I had my mouse and keyboard input rudely stolen from me by a
rogue SDL app.  I had way too much stuff going on in X to throw it all away for
some rude app, so I fought my way back!  Here's how I did it...

<h2>Kill the app</h2>

First order of business is to kill the app that's
causing the problem in the first place.  If you can switch to a console with
Ctrl+Alt+Fn, you're good to go, otherwise you'll have to login remotely. If you
have no other machines handy, you may have to admit defeat and either kill X
with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, or, even worse, reboot the machine.  kill, kill, and
kill -9 until there is no remaining trace of the program.

<h2>Get your input back</h2>

There's a number of loosely related and intertwined steps to this.

<ul>
 <li><code>kill -USR1 <pid_of_X></code> - I honestly have no idea what this
 is meant for, but it surely did something.  Namely, it messed up my
 virtual consoles, but only temporarily.  A ^L or 'clear' in your shell
 should get them back to normal.  <strong>Update:</strong>  Another X lockup was
 completely fixed by doing this a few times in a row.  So it is quite
 useful. :)</li>
 <li><code>xrefresh</code> - This didn't seem to do anything, but hey, maybe
 it'll do something for you.</li>
 <li><code>xvidtune -unlock</code> - This got my mouse input (mostly) back (woohoo!).</li>
 <li>I found some sdl C code for grabbing/ungrabbing input from a google search, and in light of other things, I don't think it did anything for me.  My logic is trying to tell me that it shouldn't really do anything, either, but I don't know much about sdl, so I'll just play stupid and put it on this page anyways.  Maybe it'll help you.
<pre class="c"><code>/* compile with: gcc `sdl-config --cflags --libs` foo.c */
#include "SDL.h"
int main(void) {
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
  SDL_WM_GrabInput(SDL_GRAB_ON);
  SDL_ShowCursor(0);
  SDL_WM_GrabInput(SDL_GRAB_OFF);
  SDL_ShowCursor(1);
  SDL_Quit();
  return 0;
}</code></pre>
  UPDATE - Apparently this does help; Neverball bombed on me, and this
  fixed my mouse afterwards.</li>
 <li><em>Fix your window manager</em> - My alt key was working for a alt+mouse keybinding I have set up, and Ctrl+Alt+<a href="+-]">worked, but normal keys weren't working.  And if I tried to move windows around, my mouse would get in this funky maybe-grabbed-maybe-not state.  I ended up killing and restarting my [http://kahakai.sf.net wm</a> a couple times, however, it seemed to have no effect - which I believe might be due to the fact that I was in a virtual console the whole time.  Logically that makes no sense to me, but it seems that you can't use logic with computers and expect it to work out perfectly.  Finally, I just used the "restart" option on my root menu, and all was well!  The missing link.  However -- due to the way that most peoples' X sessions are set up to run, you may not have room to work here.</li>
</ul>
