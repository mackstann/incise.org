<p><a href="http://github.com/mackstann/htpicker">htpicker</a> is a simple file
browser for your Linux-based HTPC (Home Theater PC).  It simply navigates your
filesystem and allows you to watch or play your media files with the programs
of your choice.</p>

<p>There are no over-complicated plugins, scripts, XML files, or anything like
that.  There is one small configuration file located at
<code>~/.htpickerrc</code>.  This file will be created for you the first time
you run htpicker.  The meat of this config file is mapping certain directories
and/or file extensions to programs that can play them.  The stock config file
sets up a few reasonable defaults, such as using mplayer to play files in
<code>~/Videos</code> as well as files with common video filename extensions,
and playing a couple types of video game ROMs with their respective
console emulators.  You can change or expand these settings to play any file
with any program you want.</p>

<p>Since htpicker's GUI is written in HTML and JavaScript (using WebKit), it
does not engage any special video modes or cause problems with switching to
other programs.  It can run in a window or fullscreen (the toggle is in the
config file).  Despite using WebKit for its GUI, it is not a web application,
and does not access the network in any way.</p>

<p>This project is still quite young, so testers and experimenters are highly
encouraged to try it out.  I don't recommend you use it yet if you expect total
robustness and zero bugs.</p>

<p>There are also some things that still need doing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Joystick support
    <li>Remote (lirc) support
    <li>Theming via CSS
    <li>JavaScript hacking/hooks
    <li>Thumbnails (maybe)
    <li>Perhaps expanding the UI to be more than just a file list.
</ul>
