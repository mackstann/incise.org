<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  This page is wrong.  First off, using this method is
slow when using X11 over a network, since every single key/button even requires
a round-trip to determine what to do with it.  Second and more importantly,
there seems to be a problem with programs which are too slow to keep up with
repeated key presses -- events get dropped or repeated in strange ways and key
repeat breaks.  I can't say I understand it fully, because I haven't gone into
Xlib or the X server code to figure out exactly how this stuff is implemented.
All I can say is that it's extremely convoluted and undocumented and I just
don't want to deal with it anymore. So it's back to asynchronous
<code>XGrabKey</code> and <code>XGrabButton</code>... bummer.</p>

<p>The following is the old content of this page, which should not serve as a
definitive answer as I once though it was.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is a problem with doing key combos with Xlib, and that is, how do can you
dynamically decide to not handle a key combo?  Generally if you're writing a
window manager or keygrabber or whatever, you read a config file and grab some
known key combinations, and it's that simple.  But what if your key combo
handling "rules" aren't quite so static?  What if you want to match against some
sort of logic that can't be predetermined at the time of your <code>XGrabKey</code>
calls?</p>

<p>Well the answer is pretty simple, but seemed elusive for quite a while.
Basically, to swallow a keycombo, you use <code>XAllowEvents</code> with
<code>ReplayKeyboard</code> on both the <code>KeyPress</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>KeyRelease</code>
events that match your keybinding.  To pass a keycombo on to the client
windows, you use <code>XAllowEvents</code> with <code>AsyncKeyboard</code> <strong>and</strong> do an
<code>XFlush</code>.  If you don't do an <code>XFlush</code>, then quickly repeated keycombos
(like when you're holding the keys down and they auto-repeat) will get "lost."</p>
