Corn is a small<a href="#well-sorta"><sup>*</sup></a>
music playing daemon.  It strikes a balance between nerdy
programmable flexibility and modern desktop integration.

<h2>key features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Uses libxine for playback -- supports the many file formats that xine does.</li>
    <li>Uses D-BUS and the <a
        href="http://mpris.org/">MPRIS</a> standard for
        inter-process communication.</li>
    <li>Scriptable via any language with D-BUS bindings, or via <a
        href="mpris-remote.html">mpris-remote</a> on the command line, and compatible with a number
        of other <a href="mpris-speaking-programs.html">MPRIS-speaking programs and libraries</a>.</li>
    <li>Uses <a
        href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/#sect:gvfs-gio">GIO/GVFS</a>
        to access media files locally or through a number of protocols. (SFTP, HTTP,
        FTP, WebDAV, SMB, inside of gzipped/bzipped tarballs)</li>
    <li>Uses SQLite for metadata storage.  Stores all metadata but scans it
        lazily, so importing music and beginning playback is fast.</li>
    <li>Is fairly small and simple, especially for a program in C: around 2000 lines of code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>never-asked-but-anticipated questions</h2>

<h3>don't have a dbus session bus running?</h3>

If you use <code>startx</code> with a smaller window manager instead of a full
blown desktop environment, you may not have a dbus session bus running.  The
system bus (<code>dbus-daemon --system</code> in your <code>ps</code> output)
will not do -- it is not for communication between user apps.  To get a session
bus running, put this in your .xinitrc:

<pre class="sh"><code>if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then
    eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi</code></pre>

<h3>selecting an audio driver</h3>

For me, libxine by default tries to connect to a pulse audio daemon with a
timeout, which caused a startup delay for corn.  But corn has its own xine
config file, which is at <code>~/.config/corn/xine_config</code>.  You can just
symlink it to <code>~/.xine/config</code> if you want corn to use the same
libxine settings as the xine program, or it can be its own separate file.  Here
is my <code>xine_config</code>:

<pre><code>audio.driver:alsa
engine.decoder_priorities.mad:1000</code></pre>

<h3><a name="well-sorta"><sup>*</sup>well, depends on what you mean by small</a></h3>

Corn actually uses kind of a lot of memory right now (60-80MB for me).  This is
a libxine problem, apparently due to it <a
    href="http://paul-pach.blogspot.com/2008/03/finding-bloat-in-kde4.html?showComment=1208382840000#c4871031230157608326">allocating
    tons of unnecessary buffers</a>.  Supposedly it will be fixed sometime.
But even until then -- hey -- 80MB is only about 4% of 2GB!

What I really care about when it comes to smallness is the size and complexity
of the code.
