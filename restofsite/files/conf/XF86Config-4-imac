# This is a working XFree86 config file for an imac DV SE, with rage 128
# graphics chip.  It was mostly generated by debconf, but some fiddling was
# done mostly based on googling and experimenting.  It took a while to get it
# actually working, so here's the working config, should anyone actually find
# this...  There are some possibly superfluous options that might not be needed,
# but once we got it working, there was no sense in messing with a good thing.

# On debian, you should be able to just drop this in /etc/X11/ and fire up X
# right away.  On other OSes you might need to fiddle a little with font paths
# or modules or whatever.
