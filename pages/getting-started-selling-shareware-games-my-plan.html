<h3>The Game</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Concept: enhanced remake of Dr. Mario</li>
 <li>Name: Dr. ????</li>
 <li>Graphics: better looking than original -- similar to tetris time attack video?</li>
 <li>Sound: need to find music & sound effects I can use</li>
 <li>Gameplay: mostly the same as the original.</li>
 <li>Shareware approach: Free limited demo.  Download full version upon payment.</li>
 <li>Demo limitations: ????</li>
 <li>Piracy protection: None.  Most people who pirate it wouldn't have paid anyway, and most people who pay won't even think to pirate it, or know how, or know that they can.  Also, the people who pirate it can end up promoting it to others.</li>
 <li>Perhaps introduce a character or <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1989.asp">brand</a> that can be used again in future games?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supporting Crap</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Website<ul>
  <li><a href="http://sonicron.solaristudios.com/2006/04/08/double-your-sales-screenshots/">This</a> suggests that screenshots are very important and I agree.  It also suggests video, which I also think is a great idea.  The last point it makes is that about 95% of people can view flash videos, which makes it the best choice as far as getting the most people to see video without hassle.  There is a reason google video and youtube use flash instead of wmv/mov/real/whatever.</li>
