<p>The simple act of acquiring a piece of shared memory through the SYSV SHM
API is fiendishly tedious.  This page used to have &ldquo;simple&rdquo; in the
title, as in, <em>a simple way to do this</em>, but it was a bad title because
there really is no simple way, if you're using the raw system call API.  But
this an example, at least.</p>

<p>If you want to use multiple blocks of shared memory in a single process then
you might need to pass a different id to <code>ftok()</code> for each one.  I
used the same block every time so I had no need for that.</p>

<p>In any case, the main entry point is <code>open_shm()</code>. It returns a
block of shared memory of the specified size. If <code>justreading</code> is 1
and there's been data written to the block of shared mem, then you access what
has already been written. Otherwise, you create a new one with undefined
contents.</p>

<p>Once you get your memory block successfully returned to you by
<code>open_shm()</code>, you can treat it like any other block of memory that
you'd get from e.g.  <code>malloc()</code>.</p>
