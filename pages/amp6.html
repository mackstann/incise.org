<h2>my 41hz.com amp6 project</h2>

I'm building a little stereo amp based on the <a
    href="http://41hz.com">41hz.com</a> amp6 kit.  I'm doing this because
typical stereo receivers waste a lot of power due to being class A/B
amplifiers, they're somewhat-annoyingly large, and just because I like
designing/building stuff.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to notice a difference
in sound since I don't consider myself to have great hearing -- not to mention
the fact that I'm generally listening to music from a computer with cheap
on-board sound -- but the 41hz amps are considered to have very high fidelity,
as are other amps based on Tripath chips in general.

I'm spending more than the minimum for decent quality parts, although it is
still very cheap by "audiophile" standards.  The gold rca jacks and binding
posts, noble potentiometer, and tocos 4pdt switches are all of higher quality
than I could have gotten away with if I wanted to be extremely cheap.  But
input signals in particular are very susceptible to the quality of the
components they run through, so everything the signal travels through before
arriving at the amp board has either silver or gold contacts.

Another issue is "vampire power" or the trickle of power consumption that many
devices exhibit when apparently turned off.  This amp will be designed so that
the power switch will cut off the a/c connection and no transformers or
anything else will be consuming any energy when it is switched off.

<h3>concerns about specific parts</h3>

<h2>source selector switch(es)</h2>

Rotary switches seem to be more expensive than toggles for the same amount of
switching.  I don't have much personal preference, so toggles it is.  Most
switches have copper contacts (the parts inside which actually touch each other
when switched) which are fine for most purposes, but can cause sound
degradation if used with audio, especially line-level, which is relatively
weak.  Gold-plated contacts avoid this problem by not oxidizing, but gold
contacts are usually plated over nickel, which is a comparatively poor
conductor, although the real-world significance of this is questionable.
Nickel is looked down upon by "audiophiles" which is of dubious validity, but
we can mostly ignore the issue because switches with silver contacts seem to be
more common anyway, and maybe cheaper.  Silver contacts do oxidize, but the
layer of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_oxide">silver oxide</a>
is very thin and the action of switching will generally wipe it away, not to
mention the fact that silver oxide is conductive anyway, while <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_oxide">copper oxide</a> is a
semiconductor and apparently acts as an insulator in this circumstance.

Another concern is whether or not to switch the input grounds or just have them
all connected together all the time.  I tried to answer this question, but
continually found conflicting information.  In any case, there can be no harm
in taking the extra effort to switch them, since it is equivalent to only
having a single input, which obviously is fine.  So we need a switch that has
four poles (right pos/neg, left pos/neg).  An on/off/on 4PDT switch will switch
between two sources, with the middle position selecting neither.  If you only
had two inputs, an on/on 4PDT would be appropriate, but I want four inputs, so
I'll use two 4PDT on/off/on switches, with one switching between source 1/2 and
the other switching between 3/4.  If both switches are in an "on" position,
I'll have two sources mixed together, which is not something I need or want, so
it will require slightly more human effort to make sure one switch is off
before using the other, but that's negligable to me.  Every 4PDT switch with
silver contacts that I could find was around 10-15 dollars each, until I found
the one at web-tronics, which is $3.50.  I couldn't find any actual reviews of
web-tronics, but the people at the diyaudio.com forums <a
    href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adiyaudio.com+web-tronics.com">seem
    to be okay with them</a>.


<h3>the end, for now</h3>

I probably won't be building this until late 2008 or early 2009.  I seem to
have gotten all the parts and design figured out, so until then, this page
remains to be continued...
