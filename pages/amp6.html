<h2>my 41hz.com amp6 project</h2>

I'm building a little stereo amp based on the <a
    href="http://41hz.com">41hz.com</a> amp6 kit.  I'm doing this because
typical stereo receivers waste a lot of power due to being class A/B
amplifiers, they're somewhat-annoyingly large, and just because I like
designing/building stuff.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to notice a difference
in sound since I don't consider myself to have great hearing -- not to mention
the fact that I'm generally listening to music from a computer with cheap
on-board sound -- but the 41hz amps are considered to have very high fidelity,
as are other amps based on Tripath chips in general.

I'm spending more than the minimum for decent quality parts, although it is
still very cheap by "audiophile" standards.  The gold rca jacks and binding
posts, noble potentiometer, and tocos 4pdt switches are all of higher quality
than I could have gotten away with if I wanted to be extremely cheap.  But
input signals in particular are very susceptible to the quality of the
components they run through, so everything the signal travels through before
arriving at the amp board has either silver or gold contacts.

Another issue is "vampire power" or the trickle of power consumption that many
devices exhibit when apparently turned off.  This amp will be designed so that
the power switch will cut off the a/c connection and no transformers or
anything else will be consuming any energy when it is switched off.

I probably won't be building this until late 2008 or early 2009.  I seem to
have gotten all the parts and design figured out, so until then, this page
remains to be continued...
