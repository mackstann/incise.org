<h2>my 41hz.com amp6 project</h2>

I'm building a little stereo amp based on the <a
    href="http://41hz.com">41hz.com</a> amp6 kit.  I'm doing this because
typical stereo receivers waste a lot of power due to being class A/B
amplifiers, they're somewhat-annoyingly large, and just because I like
designing/building stuff.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to notice a difference
in sound since I don't consider myself to have great hearing -- not to mention
the fact that I'm generally listening to music from a computer with cheap
on-board sound -- but the 41hz amps are considered to have very high fidelity,
as are other amps based on Tripath chips in general.

I'm spending more than the minimum for decent quality parts, although it is
still very cheap by "audiophile" standards.  The most notable expense is the
alps blue velvet potentiometer.

Another issue is "vampire power" or the trickle of power consumption that many
devices exhibit when apparently turned off.  This amp will be designed so that
the power switch will cut off the a/c connection and no transformers or
anything else will be consuming any energy when it is switched off.

<h3>concerns about specific parts</h3>

<h4>source selector switch(es)</h4>

Rotary switches seem to be more expensive than toggles for the same amount of
switching.  I don't have much personal preference, so toggles it is.  Most
switches have copper contacts (the parts inside which actually touch each other
when switched) which are fine for most purposes, but can cause sound
degradation if used with audio, especially line-level, which is relatively
weak.  Gold-plated contacts avoid this problem by the fact that gold doesn't
oxidize, but gold contacts are usually plated over nickel, which is a
comparatively poor conductor, although the real-world significance of this is
questionable.  Nickel is looked down upon by "audiophiles" which is of dubious
validity, but we can mostly ignore the issue because switches with silver
contacts seem to be more common anyway, and maybe cheaper.  Silver contacts do
oxidize, but the layer of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_oxide">silver oxide</a> is very
thin and the action of switching will generally wipe it away, not to mention
the fact that silver oxide is conductive anyway, while <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_oxide">copper oxide</a> is a
semiconductor and apparently acts as an insulator in this circumstance.

If you only had two inputs, an on/on DPDT would be appropriate, but I want four
inputs, so I'll use two DPDT on/off/on switches, with one switching between
source 1/2 and the other switching between 3/4.  If both switches are in an
"on" position, I'll have two sources mixed together, which is not something I
need or want, so it will require slightly more human effort to make sure one
switch is off before using the other, but that's.  I couldn't find any actual
reviews of web-tronics, but the people at the diyaudio.com forums <a
    href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adiyaudio.com+web-tronics.com">seem
    to be okay with them</a>.

It took a long time for me to get a straight answer on whether the negatives
from the input sources need to be kept separate from each other (requiring a
4PDT switch to switch both the positives and the negatives), but finally I
discovered that the answer is no.  You just connect all the negatives together,
and only the positives go through the switches.


<h3>the end, for now</h3>

I probably won't be building this until late 2008 or early 2009.  I seem to
have gotten all the parts and design figured out, so until then, this page
remains to be continued...
