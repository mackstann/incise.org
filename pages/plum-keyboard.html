<p>Review: It sucks beyond comprehension.  The keys feel worse than a $10 Wal-Mart
keyboard, the whole thing reeks of low quality, and the layout is gimmicky and
understandably ignored.  Its one mildly redeeming feature was that I only spent
$25 thanks to its "new low price" (which has been $25 for a really long time).</p>
