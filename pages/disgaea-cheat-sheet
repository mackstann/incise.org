/!\ None of this was written by me.  I merely stole the best parts from <a href="http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=589678&topic=23629866">this GameFAQs thread</a> and reformatted them.

<h2>Specialists</h2>

For each specialist in an item when you kill an item General/King/God, that item will get a stat boost of the same type as the Specialist. Note that the level of those Specialists doesn't matter; only their number.

For every humanoid weapon (swords, axes, etc.), when you get to floor 100 FROM FLOOR 99 (it doesn't work if you Gency out at floor 100 and come back), the Item God will be equipped with the next Rank of the type of Item you're in. If you're in a Rank 40 humanoid weapon or you're not in a humanoid weapon, the IG will carry the same item you're in.

<h2>Weapons</h2>

BEST HUMANOID WEAPON: Yoshi tsuna (Yoshi). It's the Rank 40 sword. It has a range of 5, and awesome stats. To get one, you need to go through all 100 floors in a Legendary Cosmic Blade or in another Yoshi, and steal it from the Item God (or Item God 2) there. Since the IG and IG2 are extremely powerful, it is HIGHLY recommended to exit on floor 99 and save, then reenter and beat the last 2 floors. DO NOT exit on floor 100, because if you do so, the IG won't have a Yoshi
anymore when you reenter. You don't need to go through the 99 first floors at once.

To get a Legendary Cosmic Blade, if you're lucky, you can steal one from the enemies in the Item World or get one in the Bonus Gauge. If you're unlucky, you can steal it from the IG on floor 100 in a Legendary Amano Hahakiri (same recommendations as the Yoshi).

BEST STAT-BOOSTING EQUIPMENT: Super Robot Suit (SRS). You can steal it from Baal (optional boss) or from the Item God 2 in another SRS (same stuff as the Yoshi).

BEST OTHER EQUIPMENT : Hyperdrive (HD). This item enables the character who equips it to teleport anywhere on the map. You get it the first time you kill an Item God 2. It appears automatically in your inventory (or in the shop if your inventory is full). You can get more HDs by stealing them from the Item God 2 in another HD (same stuff as the Yoshi tsuna).

BEST MONSTER WEAPON: Nemesis Mark-I. Just like the SRS, you can steal it from Baal or from the Item God 2 in another Nemesis Mark-I.

Where can I get a legendary Amano Hahakiri? The same way you can get any other Legendary item: either by stealing it from an enemy or by getting it in a Bonus Gauge. The quickest way (if you're strong enough) would be to beat Beauty of Evil (the map where you get Marjoly) and then get back there until the sword-wielding Majin has a LAH (he always has an AH, but its Rarity is random).

<h2>Item World</h2>

Item God 2s only appear at floor 100 of Rank 40 Items. With no "Stronger Enemies" bills, they are level 6933.

<h2>Character Classes</h2>

Are Rogues worth the trouble? Yes. 99% chance of stealing success (the others cap at 50%). Only they (and Thursday) can steal stats. Much higher chance of success than the other classes of the same level (a rogue with half the level of the enemy he's robbing has almost always 99%).

The last Prinny tier is Big Sis Prinny, and it can only be unlocked with a hacking device.

<h2>Transmigration</h2>

Each time a character transmigrates, his/her current level is added to a grand total. Next time s/he transmigrates, that grand total is used to determine how many bonus points s/he gets. The cap for this grand total is around 185000.

<h2>Misc</h2>

How can I level up a Cleric easily? Give him/her a mage pupil and have him/her learn a few offensive spells. You can also make him/her participate in team attacks and have him/her on the battlefield when you win a battle with Exp bonus in the Bonus Gauge. And of course, don't forget to give your Cleric a lv300 Statistician.

The stats of your weapon get a bonus based on your Weapon Mastery level (for monsters, it's the level of the monster). So, if you put say a Gladiator in your weapon, your Atk stat will get a higher boost than if you put the same Gladiator in your armor.

I have a character with 25+ Spear Mastery, yet I can't get Longinus! Enter and exit the Dark Assembly, then speak to Longinus again.
