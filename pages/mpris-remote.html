mpris-remote is a utility that talks to an <a
    href="http://mpris.org/">MPRIS</a>-capable music player.
It works with my music daemon, <a href="corn.html">corn</a>, as well as other
players that support MPRIS (todo: make a list).  Right now it only implements
the MPRIS 1.0 spec, but I want to expand it to support the non-standard D-BUS
interfaces in various players, since they are much more rich than the basic
command set of MPRIS.  And hopefully there will be future revisions of the spec
that add important functionality (like <a
    href="http://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/mpris/2008-December/000035.html">this</a>).

Code at <a href="http://github.com/mackstann/mpris-remote/tree/master">github</a>.

<pre class="sh"><code>git clone git://github.com/mackstann/corn.git</code></pre>

The usage text is hopefully pretty self-explanatory.
