Whimsy is a small, highly hackable window manager written in Python.

It's currently around 1000 lines SLOC (physical source lines of code, according
to sloccount) and supports a tiny bit of the
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/wm-spec">Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)</a>
spec.

<h2>why python?</h2>

Most window managers are written in C or C++ and bend over backwards to
implement config files, or IPC with pipes/sockets, or other contrived schemes
to essentially try and add some flexibility to a static, compiled language.
Why reinvent all that for the thousandth time?  Using a dynamic language like
Python cuts out a lot of junk that's just not essential to the task of managing
windows.  It's also much more flexible&mdash;which is my main goal&mdash;and
plenty fast enough as well.

Whimsy is <em>entirely</em> written in Python.  There are no funky Python-to-C
bridges or wrappers or anything of that nature.  It uses
<a href="http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/">python-xlib</a> to communicate
with the X server.  python-xlib is also written in pure Python.

<h2>what about tiling?</h2>

The tiling window managers (ion, xmonad, wmii, dwm, etc.) out there are pretty
neat, but I just don't care for tiling.  It feels unpredictable, in a bad way.
I've found that I really only have a handful of different ways of arranging
windows<sup>*</sup>, and a handful of key bindings to explicitly make windows
do these things is the most natural way of dealing with them that I've found.

<small><sup>*</sup> which generally are: fill left half of screen, or right
half, or full screen, or just float above at whatever size</small>

I'm sure it wouldn't be a total nightmare for someone to implement tiling in
whimsy, but it seems that that niche has been filled pretty well, so I doubt it
would be worth it.

<h2>usage</h2>

Quick start:

<pre class="sh"><code>$ wget http://incise.org/files/dev/whimsy-0.1a1.tgz
$ tar zxvf whimsy-0.1a1.tgz
$ sh whimsy-0.1a1/fetch-python-xlib.sh
$ mv Xlib whimsy-0.1a1/
$ export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/whimsy-0.1a1:$PYTHONPATH"
$ python whimsy-0.1a1/config.py</code></pre>

If you have a window manager running, then you'll get an exception saying so.
You will need to kill your window manager and/or start up a new X server and/or
edit your .xinitrc or .xsession file.  Due to its early stage of development, I
do not recommend using whimsy as the final blocking command in your
<code>.xinitrc</code> or <code>.xsession</code>, as this will cause your whole
X session to die if whimsy does.  What I would do is put this in its place:

<pre class="sh"><code>export PYTHONPATH="path/to/whimsy-0.1a1:$PYTHONPATH"
xterm &amp;
while true; do sleep 1000000; done</pre></code>

That way, when X starts up, you'll be greeted with a terminal with which to
start whimsy (<code>python path/to/whimsy-0.1a1/config.py</code>), and your X
session will run forever.

As you can see, you actually run your config file.  In that sense, whimsy is
almost a library or toolkit, and your config file is a little script that uses
it.  As long as you keep the top level <code>whimsy</code> directory in your
<code>PYTHONPATH</code>, you can put your config script anywhere and call it
anything.  It will just need to import <code>whimsy.base_config</code>.  You
can also check out my personal config script, <code>example_config.py</code>,
and run it like this:

<pre class="sh"><code>$ python whimsy/example_config.py</code></pre>

Running it inside of <code>screen</code> is a decent idea, so if it crashes you
can switch to a virtual console and re-attach and see what went wrong and start
it up again.

You could also install python-xlib via your package manager, although Whimsy is
developed against python-xlib's svn trunk so you could potentially have
compatability problems with older versions of python-xlib.

<h3>default interface</h3>

The most important things you will need to know are:

<ul>
    <li>Alt+left click will move a window</li>
    <li>Alt+right click will resize a window</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Alt+X will open an xterm</li>
</ul>

Beyond that, you can view the default key/mouse bindings in
<a href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/config.py"><code>config.py</code></a>.
My own personal config file is
<a href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/example_config.py"><code>example_config.py</code></a>.

There are no window borders/decorations.  There is support for viewports/large
desktops, which are basically like virtual desktops, but are "physically"
linked in that a window hanging off of one will show up partially in the next,
instead of each desktop being its own isolated little world.  (Desktops are implemented by hiding/showing windows.  Viewports are implemented by <em>moving</em> all windows over by one screen's-width or screen's-height.)  There aren't many
window management operations implemented other than the basics: moving,
resizing, closing, raising, lowering.

<h2>general design</h2>

Whimsy is built in a somewhat decentralized, indirect way.  The main point of a
window manager, especially one that you want to customize, is to decide what to
do with X events, and then do it.  All of this decision-making and execution of
actions is kept largely decoupled from the core of the window manager.  It's
essentially an implementation of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC</a> using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a>,
with a single "publisher" object, which is called the <strong>hub</strong>.

<h3>models</h3>

Right now the only models are the <strong>window manager</strong> and the
<strong>client</strong>.

<h3>controllers</h3>

The <strong>tick controller</strong> is dead simple and simply sends out tick
signals (through the hub, to whoever wants to receive them) in an
almost-endless loop.  Some handlers for things like SIGINT call its
<code>stop</code> method which will abort the endless loop at the end of the
current iteration and allow for a clean shutdown and exit.

The <strong>X event controller</strong> responds to tick signals and checks for
new X events.  It then sends out its own signal when it finds an event.  Event
handlers can in turn listen for <em>that</em> signal and do whatever they want
to handle the event.

<h3>other stuff</h3>

<strong>Actions</strong> are the callbacks that actually implement the desired
functionality to handle events.

<strong>Filters</strong> inspect events and return a boolean indicating whether
the event meets certain conditions, such as certain keyboard state, or what
type of window is involved.

I think that the X server could probably be considered the view.  MVC can be
confusing.  I don't take it too seriously.
