Whimsy is a highly hackable window manager written in Python.  It is currently
pre-alpha or maybe alpha quality and is somewhat suitable for use, depending on
your expectations.  The main mechanism of event handling is the listener
pattern, also known as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a>.
Here is <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy/main.py">main.py</a>,
which still contains my own personal key/mouse bindings, since I've pretty much
been developing whimsy hermit-style so far.  It should give you a decent idea
of what Whimsy is like to play with, code-wise.  <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy">Here</a> is the
rest of the code for browsing at github.  <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy/actions/ewmh.py">Here</a>
is ewmh.py which will show you which <a

have been implemented thus far.

<h2>code/usage</h2>

CODE MAY BE UNSTABLE AND LOCK YOUR X SERVER.  In theory, it should kill and rerun itself after hanging for 20 seconds via alarm().

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/mackstann/whimsy.git
$ cd whimsy
$ sh runit
</pre>

There are no window borders/decorations.  There is support for viewports/large
desktops (which are basically like virtual desktops, but are "physically"
linked in that a window hanging off of one will show up partially in the next,
instead of being completely isolated little worlds).  There aren't many window
management operations implemented other than the basics: moving, resizing,
closing, raising, lowering, and executing commands.  You can also execute
arbitrary Python, of course.

<h2>status</h2>

Whimsy has been an on again, off again toy project of mine since sometime in
2005.  I've been using it as my normal window manager since around March 2007.
