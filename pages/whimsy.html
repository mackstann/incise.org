Whimsy is a highly hackable window manager written in Python.  It is currently
pre-alpha or maybe alpha quality and is somewhat suitable for use, depending on
your expectations.  The main mechanism of event handling is the listener
pattern, also known as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">observer pattern</a>.
Here is <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy/main.py">main.py</a>,
which still contains my own personal key/mouse bindings, since I've pretty much
been developing whimsy hermit-style so far.  It should give you a decent idea
of what Whimsy is like to play with, code-wise.  <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy">Here</a> is the
rest of the code for browsing at github.  <a
href="http://github.com/mackstann/whimsy/tree/master/whimsy/actions/ewmh.py">Here</a>
is ewmh.py which will show you which <a

have been implemented thus far.

<h2>code/usage</h2>

CODE MAY BE UNSTABLE AND LOCK YOUR X SERVER.  In theory, it should kill and rerun itself after hanging for 20 seconds via alarm().

You should either install python-xlib via whatever means you are comfortable
with, or you can run fetch-python-xlib.sh to fetch it from svn and then add the
appropriate directory to your PYTHONPATH manually.  Whimsy is developed against
svn trunk so you could possibly have problems with older versions of
python-xlib.

To run whimsy:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/mackstann/whimsy.git
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/whimsy:$PYTHONPATH
$ python whimsy/whimsy/main.py
</pre>

I generally run it in a loop in case it dies (which is very rare for me at this
point) and I also launch it inside of screen:

<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/dev/whimsy
screen -S whimsy -d -m -- sh -c 'while true; do python dev/whimsy/whimsy/main.py; done'
</pre>

There are no window borders/decorations.  There is support for viewports/large
desktops (which are basically like virtual desktops, but are "physically"
linked in that a window hanging off of one will show up partially in the next,
instead of being completely isolated little worlds).  There aren't many window
management operations implemented other than the basics: moving, resizing,
closing, raising, lowering, and executing commands.  You can also execute
arbitrary Python, of course.

<h2>status</h2>

Whimsy has been an on again, off again toy project of mine since sometime in
2005.  I've been using it as my normal window manager since around March 2007.
