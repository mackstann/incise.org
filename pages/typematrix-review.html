<a href="/images/typematrix/">A few pictures of my own</a> (The things on
the sides are the rubber feet; I took them off the bottom so it didn't wobble
when it was half hanging off the edge of the desk)

<h1>Initial Overview</h1>

I've been casually using the keyboard for a few hours now, and here are my
thoughts thus far:

<h2>The good</h2>

<ul>
 <li>All of the features touted on their site. If you're reading this page, then
 you've probably already been to the typematrix site and are familiar with the
 keyboard. If not, <a href="http://typematrix.com">read up!</a></li>
 <li>The keyboard is a lot thinner than I thought; it's probably less than a
 half inch thick.</li>
 <li>Very solid feel.  It's essentially a laptop keyboard, and I like the feel
 of laptop keyboards.  It's also structurally strong, and doesn't flex much,
 unlike many keyboards.</li>
 <li>The keys and typematrix logo are aesthetically pleasing.</li>
 <li>Their staff seems very friendly.  I emailed them with a question
 before ordering, and received a quick response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The weird or interesting</h2>

<ul>
 <li>What's up with the bright red delete key?</li>
 <li>The alt-tab key is kinda spiffy.  I'm not sure if I'll end up actually using
 it or not. (update: actually I hate the thing)</li>
 <li>The "00" (double zero) key on the numpad just types a zero. Inspection
 with xev shows that it's seemingly identical to the numpad zero key, keycode
 and all.  I'm not sure if it types two zeroes in windows, or if it's even
 supposed to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What could be improved</h2>

This list is disproportionately larger than the good, because
they already tell you most of the good things.  You have to figure out the
bad things by using it.  I decided to call these "what could be improved"
instead of "the bad," because none of them are really *that* bad.

</ul>
 <li>It's not very sexy.  The area above where the keys are is the ugliest,</li>
 with the little plastic ridges in the middle, and the area with the LEDs is
 ugly too.  The keyboard isn't outright ugly, but it could be improved a bit.</li>
 <li>Along the same lines, it would be cool if they had a black version.</li>
 <li>It's ps/2 only, and the USB adapter is fifteen bucks!  That's obscene,
 especially when the keyboard is already $100.  Not a problem for most people
 though (including myself).</li>
 <li>The home, end, pgup, and pgdn keys are on the F9 through F12 keys,
 and you have to hold the function key to use them.  And to compound the issue,
 the function key is on the other end of the keyboard, requring both hands on
 the keyboard to access these keys.  You can fix this pretty easily with
 xmodmap, though.</li>
 <li>The cluster of 6 keys at bottom left could be better arranged.
 Ideally, the Alt and Application keys would be swapped.  This might be
 specific to my hands.</li>
 <li>The key layout could be further optimized.  The left backspace
 seems like a total waste to me; I definitely don't imagine that I will be
 using it.  I also wonder whether they could get away with only one of the
 space keys.  I personally only use my right thumb for the space key, but I'm
 guessing some people use their left, or even both.  But maybe forcing people
 to only use one would be a good thing, since they could relocate some keys to
 where the other space key was, and the other thumb could actually become
 useful instead of just sitting there.</li>
 <li>I got the dual-labeled dvorak version, but the dvorak labels
 are <strong>really</strong> hard to see!  They're this wimpy bright orange color, and on
 whitish keys, it's just hard to see.  It's even worse on the darker grey keys
 to the right. Something like dark green or dark red would probably work well
 (the dark blue for function keys is very legible).</li>
 <li>I'm used to the arrow keys being easy to identify, but they
 somewhat get lost in the other grey keys.  It would be cool if they were a
 different color.  In fact, I think more colors in general would be a good
 thing.  The F-keys could get their own color, numbers could get a color,
 letters could get a color, punctuation a color, modifiers a color, etc etc.
 Locating things by color is much, much faster than reading symbols.  But
 selling a fruit rollup keyboard might be more difficult.  Locating keys will
 also probably get a lot faster as I get used to the keyboard.</li>
 <li>Price - $100.  Probably a necessary evil, considering this is a bit of a
 niche product.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting used to the layout</h1>

I haven't done a ton of typing on the keyboard yet, but I have typed this page
on it, and overall, it's not very hard to get used to.  I do make mistakes
fairly often, like hitting tab instead of "b", or confusing the x, c, and v
keys, but I can't imagine that it will take very long to get back to normal.

The
<a href="http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reviews/4722/1/">HardwareCentral review</a>
reported to have a hard time adjusting to the center backspace and enter keys.
I expected that to be the case, and I have reached for the old spots a few
times, but it was actually pretty easy to get used to the new locations.  They
also reported having a problem with putting their hand in the wrong place on
home row for 3 days - wow!  I can't say I ever had that problem, as I tend to
never look at the keyboard, and I use the little bumps on the f and k keys to
position my hands.  From the comments they make, it seems like they might not
be touch typists, which I imagine would slow the learning process.

<h1>Overall</h1>

The keyboard is pretty much what I was expecting, which means that it's worth
$100 to me.  I probably would have even paid more for it.  Hopefully the
typematrix people are selling enough of these things to stay around, and
hopefully they can make even cooler keyboards in the future!

<h2>My rating: 9 out of 10</h2>

<h1>Hacking</h1>

<h2>Physical hacking</h2>

<strong>Do this at your own risk!</strong>  You're probably voiding the warranty.

(Forgive my lack of a digicam)

I wanted to swap some key caps, but you can't see under the keys, and it felt
too risky to just blindly pry them off without seeing exactly how they attach
to the keyboard.  So I took the thing apart, which was pretty straightforward.
There are 8 philips head screws on the bottom holding the keyboard together,
and two smaller ones in the middle holding the middle strip in place.  Unscrew
them all, and the top half of the casing pulls off.  The electronics are
screwed into the bottom piece of the casing, and the keypad is attached to that
via two ribbon cables.  The keypad is metal on the bottom and plastic on top
(you can't really take them apart), with the circuitry sandwiched in between.

The key mechanisms are kind of interesting; they're definitely different
from your average keyboard.  They call them "double scissor" keys
(<a href="<img src="/images/typematrix-keycap.jpg">">image</a>), and I assume they are
what's used on laptops, since the typematrix basically feels like a rearranged
laptop keyboard.  The keypad didn't appear to have a rubber membrane, it seemed
to have individual little rubber nipples under each key.

Anyways, to get the caps off, you basically just tug at the top and the bottom,
and the two little clips on each will pop off.  I did the bottoms and then the
tops, but I doubt the order matters.  The larger keys have the metal stabilizer
bars too, so you need to make sure and get those back into their grooves.

<h2>Swapping F9-F12 with Home/End/PgUp/PgDn</h2>

Having Home/End/Pg<strong><em>'Up/Pg</strong></em>'Dn relegated to Fn-keys is unacceptable, but thankfully,
I don't use the F9-F12 keys at all, so swapping them fixes the problem.  The
following <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a> code will swap
them around:

<pre>
keycode 75 = Home
keycode 76 = End
keycode 95 = Prior
keycode 96 = Next
keycode 97 = F9
keycode 103 = F10
keycode 99 = F11
keycode 105 = F12
</pre>

<h2>Exploiting all of those keys at bottom left</h2>

You have Shift, Control, Alt, Super ("start" on the keyboard), Menu
("application"), and caps lock -- imagine what ridiculous key bindings you can
come up with, now that you have all of these available! (Ok, maybe I'm the only
one imagining it)

<h3>The "Application" key</h3>

I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be the "menu" key, but who cares about the
menu key; we can make it another modifier!  I decided to make it Hyper_L and
mod3.  You need this xmodmap code:

<pre>
keycode 117 = Hyper_L
add mod3 = Hyper_L
</pre>

You also need to execute this to turn off repeating on the key:

<pre>
xset -r 117
</pre>
