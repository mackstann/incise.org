<p>I'm exploring ideas about visualizing Postgres query plans. There are
a few existing visualizations like
<a href="https://explain.depesz.com/">depesz</a>'s colorized tables,
<a href="https://github.com/mgartner/pg_flame">pg_flame</a>'s flame graphs, and
<a href="https://pganalyze.com/postgres-explain">pganalyze</a>'s tree view, but
there's so much information in a plan that doesn't make it into these
visualizations. I want to see more. I want an intuitive&mdash;maybe even
fun&mdash;picture of what the imaginary world of the these internal processes
looks like.</p>

<p>pg_flame's Flame graphs perhaps come the closest to what I'm looking for, but
flame graphs are ordered on the x-axis alphabetically. A flame <em>chart</em>,
in contrast, orders the x-axis by time, a property it shares with timeline
charts, like the one in Chrome's network tab. This appeals to me. It's almost
like a waveform of a sound recording. That seems like a useful analog...</p>

<p>I would also like to make use of the y-axis. Flame graphs/charts make each
item equally sized on the y-axis. This feels like a wasted opportunity. Why not
maximize the information content of every dimension? You don't get very many of
them.</p>

<p>This lead me to the idea of representing each node of the query plan as the
shape of the data it's working with: rows and their widths. I.e., rectangles. It
could look like a bunch of little tables processing in parallel and merging
together over time. As they pass through the time axis, they sort of "extrude"
into 3D boxes. If the box is tall, it has a lot of rows. If it's wide, well, the
rows are wide (maybe many columns, or wide data in them). If it's deep, it is
being worked on for a long time.</p>

<p>And here's what I was able to cook up in a fairly short amount of time:</p>

</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/jdan/isomer">Isomer</a> to draw them on
an HTML5 canvas.</p>

<p>It's a bit disorienting because the boxes aren't labeled, but you can
hopefully get a rough idea of how they correspond to the nodes in this example
query plan based on each node's <tt>rows</tt>, <tt>width</tt>, and <tt>actual
time</tt>:</p>

<p>The one thing I like best about this visualization is how it shows the flow
of work over time. Some of that involves a bit of deduction (which may not even
be correct) because Postgres only tells you when the node's first and last rows
are emitted, and not when the node actually began work.</p>

<p>This was a fun experiment, but I eventually came to the opinion that 3D
visualizations are rare for good reasons: They're harder to make (than 2D),
they're hard to view (background data is obscured by foreground data, or you
need full-on 3D rendering with a moveable camera, but that's disorienting), and
they fit awkwardly into web pages. And it's a lonely world: There seems to be a
dearth of libraries designed for this purpose. When you want to do something no
one else is doing, you might be a pioneer, or you might just be lost.</p>

<p>There are still more things I would like to try, like adding text labels, and
showing the flow of data between nodes. I still want to continue this
exploration... but probably in 2D.</p>
