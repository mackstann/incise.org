A long time ago I remember thinking it would be cool if you could use arbitrary URLs on the command line to refer to files, such as "cat http://google.com".  I wrote something to do it (using wget I think), but for some reason I never got it to work right with LD_PRELOAD.

Well it turns out that gnome's vfs (virtual file system) has a set of command line tools to do things just like this.  On ubuntu I installed the <strong>libgnomevfs2-bin</strong> package, and it gave me:

<ul>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-cat</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-copy</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-info</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-ls</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-monitor</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-mkdir</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-mv</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-rm</code></li>
    <li><code>/usr/bin/gnomevfs-df</code></li>
</ul>

These tools generally work the same as cat, cp, ls, mv, rm, etc -- except that they can use arbitrary URLs as filenames.  Such as:

<pre class="sh"><code>gnomevfs-cp sftp://foo@bar.com:somefile.txt ftp://bob:blah@poop:/tmp/</code></pre>

This is pretty cool.  The only thing that sucks is that they are pretty crude and take few or no options other than the filenames.

Also I found that if you use the sftp protocol, you need to use key auth.  If password auth is needed, it just fails.
