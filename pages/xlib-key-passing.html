There is a problem with doing key combos with Xlib, and that is, how do can you
dynamically decide to not handle a key combo?  Generally if you're writing a
window manager or keygrabber or whatever, you read a config file and grab some
known key combinations, and it's that simple.  But what if your key combo
handling "rules" aren't quite so static?  What if you want to match against some
sort of logic that can't be predetermined at the time of your <code>XGrabKey</code>
calls?

Well the answer is pretty simple, but seemed elusive for quite a while.
Basically, to swallow a keycombo, you use <code>XAllowEvents</code> with
<code>ReplayKeyboard</code> on both the <code>KeyPress</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>KeyRelease</code>
events that match your keybinding.  To pass a keycombo on to the client
windows, you use <code>XAllowEvents</code> with <code>AsyncKeyboard</code> <strong>and</strong> do an
<code>XFlush</code>.  If you don't do an <code>XFlush</code>, then quickly repeated keycombos
(like when you're holding the keys down and they auto-repeat) will get "lost."
