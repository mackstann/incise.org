<p><a href="http://github.com/mackstann/htpicker">htpicker</a> is a simple file
browser for your Linux-based HTPC (Home Theater PC).  It simply navigates your
filesystem and allows you to watch or play your media files with the programs
of your choice.</p>

<p>I created htpicker because I was unsatisfied with all other HTPC frontend
software I've tried.  They're all complicated monstrosities and I seem to have
a talent for finding their bugs.  All I really wanted was a way to browse a
directory structure in a TV-friendly visual format, and launch files with
external programs (e.g. a video with mplayer, or a video game ROM with an
emulator).</p>

<p>There are no over-complicated plugins, scripts, XML files, or anything like
that.  There is one small configuration file located at
<code>~/.htpickerrc</code>.  This file will be created for you the first time
you run htpicker.  The meat of this config file is mapping certain directories
and/or file extensions to programs that can play them.  The stock config file
sets up a few reasonable defaults, such as using mplayer to play files in
<code>~/Videos</code> as well as files with common video filename extensions,
and playing a couple types of video game ROMs with their respective
console emulators.  You can change or expand these settings to play any file
with any program you want.</p>

<p>And why not just use HTML and Javascript for the UI?  So that's what I've
done.  The program you run consists of three parts:  The first is a generic
browser window, using WebKit, the same HTML engine used by Chrome, Safari, and
the iPhone and Android browsers.  The second part is the HTML and Javascript
web page that this browser displays.  The third is a backend program that gets
requests from the webpage and executes actions that are impossible from within
a webpage, such as reading the contents of a directory on the filesystem, or
executing a program to play a file.</p>

<p>Since htpicker's GUI is written in HTML and JavaScript (using WebKit), it
does not engage any special video modes or cause problems with switching to
other programs.  It can run in a window or fullscreen (the toggle is in the
config file).  Despite using WebKit for its GUI, it is not a web application,
and does not access the network in any way.</p>

<p>This project is still quite young, so testers and experimenters are highly
encouraged to try it out.  I don't recommend you use it yet if you expect total
robustness and zero bugs.</p>
