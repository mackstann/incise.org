<h2>A procedure that takes an array argument and inserts a row for each array element</h2>

Use generate_series.
<pre>
insert into foo (
    select myarray[i]
    from generate_series(1, array_upper(myarray, 1)) as i
)
</pre>

Also seen <a href="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/merlin/index.php?/archives/4-fun-with-arrays.html">here</a>, this can be made into an explode_array function.

<pre>
create function explode_array(myarray anyarray) returns setof anyelement as
$$
    select ($1)[i] from generate_series(1, array_upper($1, 1)) as i;
$$ language sql immutable;
</pre>

Using this, the original query would become:
<pre>
insert into foo (
    select * from explode_array(myarray)
)
</pre>

<h2>Matching existing records to an array of possible matches</h2>

Just use "IN".
<pre>
update foo set a = true where b in (myarray)
</pre>

<h2>Array-building aggregate function</h2>

Also in the link mentioned above is a reference to the array_accum function
that exists in the Postgres documentation.

<pre>
select
    post.name,
    array_to_string(array_accum(tag.name), ' ') as tags
from
    post
    inner join post_tags as pt on pt.post_id = post.id
    inner join tag on tag.id = pt.tag_id
where
    post.id = ?
group by
    post.name
</pre>
