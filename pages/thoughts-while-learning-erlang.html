<h2>array/string ambiguity is uncomfortable</h2>

<pre class="erlang"><code>6&gt; [1000, 500, 4].
[1000,500,4]
7&gt; [100, 50, 4].
[100,50,4]
8&gt; [100, 50, 40].
"d2("</code></pre>

<p>gross.</p>

<blockquote>Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("), but is not a data type
in Erlang. Instead a string "hello" is shorthand for the list [$h,$e,$l,$l,$o],
that is [104,101,108,108,111]</a>.</blockquote>

<p>($y gives you the ordinal value of the letter y)</p>

<p>I guess that's kinda fun.  I'm starting to get feelings about Erlang similar to
C++ -- it's somewhat perverse, but in a way I can appreciate.</p>

<h2>boilerplate stuff</h2>

<p>filename foo.erl needs "-module(foo)" at the top of it, which is annoyingly
redundant.  although i wonder what happens when the two differ?  could this be
useful somehow? (nope, otherwise it will break code loading.  well that's
pointless)</p>

<p>The "-export" list which says which functions in a module get publicly
exported, is redundant.  I feel like I'm writing C header files again.</p>

<p>(that's hyperbole, somewhat)</p>

<h2>function name overloading</h2>

<p>Looking for the same function name but with a different number of arguments
seems a little annoying.  It would be a little more obvious to just give them
different names.  This may just be a deficiency in the coding style of the
tutorial I am reading.</p>

<h2>arbitrary base integers</h2>

<p>not really very useful for me, but i always thought it was a cool idea when i
heard of it in smalltalk (i think).  base#value where base is 2-36</p>

<p>(speaking of base 36... so that's what those dang reddit and youtube ids are!)</p>

<h2>tail call recursion optimization</h2>

<p>fun to have it; a refreshing change from python</p>

<pre class="erlang"><code>% silently does nothing forever
foo() -&gt;
    foo().</code></pre>

<pre class="python"><code># raises recursion limit error
def foo():
    foo()</code></pre>

<p>(<a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-January/059652.html">or python will segfault if you increase the recursion limit</a>)</p>
