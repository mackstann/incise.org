<p>This little article appeared in issue #44 of
<a href="http://linuxformat.co.uk">Linux Format Magazine</a> in September of
2003.  I managed to track down a print version of the article and got a copy
in the summer of 2004.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahakai">Kahakai</a>
was a window manager that I worked on for a while around that time.
