<h2>laid back</h2>

<p>Basically I want to try and make this thing as loose and informal as possible.
I hate having things unnecessarily imposed on me by other programmers, so I try
to not do it myself.</p>

<h2>no hand holding</h2>
<p>I am all for simplicity but I am not going to make much of an effort to make it
easy for non-programmers (or non-Python programmers, or whoever else might need
some hand holding). I'm not trying to be the next Fluxbox here.</p>

<h2>event handling abstractions</h2>
<p>The obvious things as far as custom event handling are key and mouse button
events, but what else?  Anything?  Doesn't seem like it. It's not that you
won't be able to do anything else, but there  is/will be more convenience code
for key/mouse stuff.</p>

<h2>event handler coordination</h2>
<p>One basic part of the event handling system is the ability to add arbitrary
event handlers and respond to events however you want.  An issue with that is
different event handlers fighting with each other over the same event -- so I
think there should be something that allows an event handler to "veto" an
event, preventing it from being handled any further. There is something similar
to this with the 'replay' functionality of key/button events, but it's a bit
different.  Currently the event handlers are stored in a sorted list of tuples,
each containing <code>(priority_int, handler_function)</code> -- thus allowing a
"priority" scheme where a handler with a priority of 5 handles an event before
one with a priority of 30.  Not totally sure how this will play out.</p>

<h2>decor</h2>
<p>???  Not quite sure about this yet.  I think ideally it should be totally
flexible, allowing the swapping in/out of different drawing systems and layouts
-- but how to do that sanely?  I have a vague idea, but haven't ever really
gone about implementing it.  We'll see.</p>

<h2>key/mouse replaying</h2>
<p>One important part of flexibly and sanely handling key/mouse events dynamically
is described in <a href="xlib-key-passing.html">xlib key passing</a>.  The example is in C but it works the same in
Python.</p>

<h2>window constraints</h2>
<p>I already have basic handling of window size hints down (min, max, base,
increments, and aspect ratio), but there should be something smarter for
coordinating multiple move/resize operations done at once, so they don't step
on each other -- metacity seems to have a good system for this in its
constraints.c. Should distill the essentials out of this and implement
something that will fit into whimsy without being too foreboding (metacity is
crazy).</p>

<h2>grabbing in advance without duplication</h2>
<p>Not sure there is a good solution to this, but I'd love to find one.  Say you
want to make Mod1+X open an xterm.  A normal wm reads a config file, stores the
bindings in some data structure, does the grabs, and executes an xterm whenever
Mod1+X arrives.  The problem is basically that we want to simply check incoming
events for various modifiers/key/whatever, and then do what we want in response
-- but we're required to set up the grabs in advance.  This means that you
basically have to state the "Mod1+X" in two different places in the code.</p>

<p><strong><em>Solution</strong></em>: suck it up and be more strict about how key/mouse bindings
are set up.  You still <em>can</em> do it in a more complex way if you really want
to, but it'll be a little more work.</p>

<h2>window db</h2>
<p>Each window can declare itself as having a certain "label" (possibly more than
one).  This way we can say, "only do this to titlebars," (windows with the
label "titlebar") or "only do this for the root window," etc.  Since we will be
dealing with raw window objects coming out of python-xlib, we can't just assign
this label to the window objects themselves, so we need a window "database" that
maps windows to labels.  The labels will simply be strings, such as "title",
"root", or "frame".</p>

<p>At first I called these "types" instead of labels, but that is less generic of
a name, and it implies that they're only intended for broad window "types,"
while in reality there's nothing wrong with using it for tagging individual
windows for whatever purpose.</p>

<h2>keybinding window sensitivity</h2>
<p>Should keybindings apply to different raw X windows (i.e., a button, a window
grip, whatever), or only focusable windows (i.e.  clients and root)?  Waimea
only lets them apply to focusable windows.  Also, we'd have to query the
pointer all the time which sucks, and it could also be pretty inconsistent with
different focus models.  So, at least for now, I think no.</p>

<h2>complex modifiers</h2>
<p>Taking care of the lock keys is already done, but even with those out of the
way, we can't do a simple equality check on modifiers, because the modifier
state in events can also contain things like <code>Button1MotionMask</code>.  So what
we should do is what Waimea/Kahakai do: allow explicit negation of modifiers --
and when a certain modifier is <em>not</em> negated, don't require it match.</p>

<p>Currently:</p>

<pre class="python"><code>ev.state == Mod1Mask | ControlMask | Button3MotionMask
modmask_to_match == Mod1Mask | ControlMask

# no match, but we probably wanted it to</code></pre>

<p>It should be something like:</p>

<pre class="python"><code>ev.state == Mod1Mask | ControlMask | Button3MotionMask
modmask_to_match == Mod1Mask "plus" ControlMask

# match</code></pre>

<pre class="python"><code>ev.state == Mod1Mask | ControlMask | Button3MotionMask
modmask_to_match == Mod1Mask "minus" ControlMask

# no match</code></pre>

<p>So basically each modmask specifies 3 "sets" of modifiers:</p>

<p><ol>
 <li>Must-be-on modifiers</li>
 <li>Must-be-off modifiers</li>
 <li>Unmentioned modifiers, which can be in any state</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Whereas a normal X modmask is:</p>

<p><ol>
 <li>Must-be-on modifiers</li>
 <li>Unmentioned modifiers, which must be off</li>
</ol></p>
