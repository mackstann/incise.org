I had <a href="amp6.html">previously planned</a> to build a small stereo amp
using the amp6 kit from 41hz.com.  After deciding I wanted a bit more power, I
did some research and am now going to build a so-called <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainclone">gainclone</a> amp based on
the LM3886 chip.

Here is a basic parts list:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>part</th><th>source</th><th>price</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/8Audio__W0QQ_sidZ416308020?_nkw=lm3886&amp;submit=Search">LM3886 amp kit</a></td>
            <td><a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.com/8Audio">8audio on ebay</a></td>
            <td>58.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="http://www.antekinc.com/trans.html">300<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr> 22V toroidal transformer</a></td>
            <td><a href="http://www.antekinc.com">Antek</a></td>
            <td>46.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3">(other parts to be filled in later)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <th colspan="2">total</th>
            <td>104.00</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>

<h2>the amp kit</h2>

There are apparently a lot of shady sellers on ebay selling chip amp kits out
of east Asia with counterfeit chips and low quality construction.  I was wary
of 8audio at first, but some searching led me to an article at <a
    href="http://www.beavishifi.com/projects/class_d_amplifier/">beavishifi.com</a>
which mentioned good experiences with them. I wrote the author, and he
re-iterated this.

The main reason I'm going with this kit is that it's pretty cheap, and it'll
save me the tedium of soldering circuits together myself, which is not
something I really love to do.

If you do want to solder the amp yourself, the <a
    href="http://chipamp.com">chipamp.com</a> kits seem to be widely respected,
or you can pretty easily roll your own, without even using a PCB, if you like.
There are many options.  Use the Google.

<h2>transformer</h2>

22V seems to be the ideal voltage for these amps.  You can go a bit lower or
higher depending on the speakers you're driving, but I'm looking to build a
pretty middle-of-the-road amp.  The lowest amount of power generally
recommended is 160<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr>.
Going a bit higher will help when playing at loud volumes, and since it was
only $7 more than the 200<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr>
model, I decided to go for the 300<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr>.

This part of the amp is much more expensive than the $15-ish laptop-style power
brick that the amp6 can use, but it'll translate to a significantly more
powerful amp.
