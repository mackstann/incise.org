I had <a href="amp6.html">previously planned</a> to build a small stereo amp
using the amp6 kit from 41hz.com.  After deciding I wanted a bit more power, I
did some research and am now going to build a so-called <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainclone">gainclone</a> amp based on
the LM3886 chip.

Here is a basic parts list:

<h2>the amp kit</h2>

There are apparently a lot of shady sellers on ebay selling chip amp kits out
of east Asia with counterfeit chips and low quality construction.  I was wary
of 8audio at first, but some searching led me to an article at <a
    href="http://www.beavishifi.com/projects/class_d_amplifier/">beavishifi.com</a>
which mentioned good experiences with them. I wrote the author, and he
re-iterated this.

The main reason I'm going with this kit is that it's pretty cheap, and it'll
save me the tedium of soldering circuits together myself, which is not
something I really love to do.

If you do want to solder the amp yourself, the <a
    href="http://chipamp.com">chipamp.com</a> kits seem to be widely respected,
or you can pretty easily roll your own, without even using a PCB, if you like.
There are many options.  Use the Google.

<h2>transformer</h2>

22<abbr title="volts">V</abbr> seems to be the ideal voltage for these amps.
You can go a bit lower or higher depending on the speakers you're driving, but
I'm looking to build a pretty middle-of-the-road amp.  The lowest amount of
power generally recommended is 160<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr>.
Going a bit higher will help when playing at loud
volumes, and since it was only $7 more than the
200<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr> model,
I decided to go for the 300<abbr title="volt-amps, also known as watts">VA</abbr>.

This part of the amp is much more expensive than the $15-ish laptop-style power
brick that the amp6 can use, but it'll translate to a significantly more
powerful amp.

<h2>digital is good</h2>

I'm going to be using this amp at my computer.  Primarily for listening to
music, but sometimes also a movie.  One of the things that bugs me about my
current setup (internal sound card connected to a typical stereo receiver) is
that a lot of noise is introduced.  When my external hard drive spins up, I can
hear it through my speakers if the volume is up a bit.  If I turn the volume up
moderately with nothing playing, I hear hiss.  This isn't the end of the world,
but it'd be nice to eliminate it, and I'm sure sound fidelity would go up at
least a tiny bit by doing so.

One source of interference is the sound card being inside of the computer, which
is a very noisy place to be, as far as audio electronics are concerned.  Another
issue is the line-level cables running from the computer to the amp.  Both of
these can be eliminated by building a
<abbr title="digital-to-analog converter">DAC</abbr> into the amp, so that the
sound path is purely digital (and thus, generally interference-free) until
right before reaching the amp circuit itself.

You can build your own <abbr
    title="digital-to-analog converter">DAC</abbr> circuit, or buy kits, but
the easiest way to go is to buy an already complete one and take it apart.

The Griffin iMic is exactly that, and it seems to generally be regarded as
having good sound quality.  To turn it into an in-amp
<abbr title="digital-to-analog converter">DAC</abbr>, all one needs to do is
connect its USB cord to a panel-mounted USB female jack, and connect its analog
output into the amp's line-level input.  There'll be a couple more components
involved since I want multiple inputs to the amp that can be toggled, and I'll
of course want a volume control, but the basic point is the same.
