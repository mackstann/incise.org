<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>The information on this page applies to the SNES version of Sim City
("Classic," not 2000).  I realize this page is a bit late, considering the game
came out over a decade ago, but I've been playing it on and off since that
point, and have found it odd that all of the info on the net about the game is
pretty rudimentary and basic, barely going beyond what's in the manual.</p>

<p>The purpose of this page is to cover some of the various strategies that can
be used to build cities with huge populations.  The largest city I have
personally built was a little over 650,000.  However, I should mention that I
haven't built a large number of large cities, because I did the majority of my
playing when I was a kid.  In recent years, I've come back to the game a few
times, learning new things each time that I didn't know back in the day, and
building bigger cities each time.</p>

<h2>Some Basics</h2>

<h3>Destroy Schools and Hospitals</h3>

<p>They don't add to the population, so nuke them.</p>

<h3>One Firestation</h3>

<p>Fire coverage is a waste of time and space.  Build one fire station to shut
the people up, but don't build any more.  At some point you might want to build
six, twelve, or eighteen fire stations, to get your HQs.  Once you build at
least one of the HQs, destroy your regular fire station.</p>

<p>So if your fire coverage sucks, how do you fight a fire?  Easy.  When a fire
breaks out, turn the time to stopped, get to the scene of the fire, bulldoze
anything around it that you can easily rebuild, build a few firestations around
it, turn the time back on, and wait for it to go out.  Then destroy your
temporary fire stations and rebuild.</p>

<h3>Optimal Transportation</h3>

<p>Most importantly, don't use roads.  Pollution and traffic suck.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you getting the highest population is the goal, then you must
use as few rails as possible (I'll get into that more, in a bit).  Each zone
only needs one square of rail touching it, and any unneeded squares should be
replaced with parks -- or, even better -- used to stack in some extra
zones.</p>

<p>And to truly milk your land, always try to use water for transportation.
Remember: you can build rails on water, but not buildings.  So whenever you're
near the coastline, try to pack in as many zones as possible, and stick your
transportation in the water.</p>

<h2>The Best Maps</h2>

<p>Each map is 120x100.</p>

<p>Generally you want less water, since obviously you can't build anything on
water.  But water isn't completely worthless: it significantly raises the land
value of the land surrounding it.  Since industrial zones don't really care
about land value, try and cover most or all of your waterfront with
residentials and commercials.</p>

<p>There is also the freedom map -- the one with the big mario face forest in
the center, and no water -- but you don't get any presents on that map, which
makes it much less useful than it seems at first.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the best maps I know of, ordered by their amount
of water (less water is better):</p>

<p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
        <tr><td><strong>map #</strong></td><td><strong>water</strong></td></tr>
        <tr><td>61      </td><td> 1740</td></tr>
        <tr><td>728     </td><td> 1830</td></tr>
        <tr><td>849     </td><td> 1941</td></tr>
        <tr><td>31      </td><td> 2071</td></tr>
        <tr><td>714     </td><td> 2134</td></tr>
        <tr><td>921     </td><td> 2153</td></tr>
        <tr><td>default </td><td> 2197</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>

<h2>The Money Trick</h2>

<p>You can easily find this on google but I'll try to sum it up as concisely as
possible:</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>set fire/police/transportation funding levels to 0%</li>
        <li>build something that has an annual tax cost -- fire/police dept., road, or rail.  one is enough.</li>
        <li>spend all of your money</li>
        <li>make sure you have auto-$ off, and wait until the tax screen pops up</li>
        <li>press and hold L -- don't let go!</li>
        <li>exit the tax screen, and then immediately re-access it via the menu</li>
        <li>raise all funding levels to 100%, exit tax screen</li>
        <li>let go of L</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>You will now have $999,999.</p>

<p>I'm sure some people think this is just lame cheating, but personally I
think it's more fun.  Trying to actually build a city the expected way is
really slow, and a pain in the ass.  Fighting the in-game economics and taxes
is boring to me; getting the highest population is a more exciting challenge to
focus on.  And that is what Sim City is all about, right?  Making your own
goals?</p>

<h2>Easy Pausing</h2>

<p>The L and R buttons pause the game.  This is how the money trick works, and it
is also extremely useful when stacking zones -- you can prevent little houses
from growing back while you're trying to bulldoze and build things.</p>

<h2>The Startup Bug</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pnaw10.com/peters-simcity-for-super-nes-guide">Here</a>
is another page with a couple useful bits -- most notably a fix for the
"startup bug." This refers to how for the first few moments after loading a
city, the power is out, crime is extremely high, etc.  The fix is to
immediately set the speed to paused, wait a minute (maybe even just 10, 20, 30
seconds or so -- I didn't test it extensively), and then resume.</p>

<p>I disagree with a thing or two on that page (big cities should have more
industrials than commercials, not vice versa -- and donuts suck), but the gifts
list is also quite useful.  I was going to put one on this page sometime, but
never got around to it.</p>

<h2>Debunkin' Donuts</h2>

<p>The donut block is widely considered to be the best arrangement for zones,
but in my opinion it definitely is not.  The two zone-wide strips have always
seemed more dense to me, and to find out the truth, I've done a test.  But
before I get to that, I should explain the various conditions that a block
arrangement needs to meet:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each zone needs transportation; this means directly touching at
        least one square of road or railroad.</li>

        <li>A block needs to be some sort of shape that is repeatable, usually
        a square or rectangle.  The idea is to take the best block arrangement
        and repeat it over the whole map, to use space in the most efficient
        manner possible.</li>

        <li>A block should try to minimize the amount of land used by road or
        railroad, thereby raising the density of the zones contained in the
        block, and lowing transportation upkeep costs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Now, what do these two arrangements look like?  The donut is a 9x9 square of
zones, with the middle zone cut out and usually used for a police department,
fire department, or gift.  The donut layout is said to maximize the land
value-raising effects of gifts, and provide a straightforward place to put
police and fire departments, since their effectiveness is the same regardless
of the transportation available to them.</p>

<p>The two zone-wide strip is simply that: a strip of zones, two wide, and of
any length.  Longer strips are preferable, as they minimize the space taken by
roads and rails.</p>

<h3>The Test</h3>

<p>So as mentioned, I decided to conduct a somewhat scientific test between the
efficiency of these two layouts.  I decided to give the donut blocks the
advantage by fitting the test area to them, and then filling the same area with
strips.  The area was 31x31 squares, which means 3x3 donut blocks, or 9
strips.</p>

<h4>Donut Results</h4>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/donut-density.png"></p>

<p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
        <tr><td></td><td>Statistics</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Number of zones</td><td>72</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Amount of rails/roads</td><td>23.2km</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>

<h4>Strip Results</h4>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/strip-density.png"></p>

<p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
        <tr><td></td><td>Statistics</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Number of zones</td><td>90</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Amount of rails/roads</td><td>12.0km</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>

<p>It now becomes quite clear that the donut layout wastes a considerable
amount of space on roads.  In fact, if we examine the layout, we can find that
each corner block is completely covered in roads on two sides.  That's six
times more than we need on those zones!  The roads on the corners also go to
waste, as they aren't even touching any zones.  These are low in number enough
to not be a big concern, but they're still wasteful.  The third problem
regarding their use of roads is the fact that each block needs to be surrounded
by roads.  Ideally, roads belong on the inside edge of any pattern, not the
outside.  Putting them on the outside is the entire reason we have so much of
them, but the donut layout doesn't leave us with much other choice.  This also
causes problems when you reach the end of the map and are one block short; the
center zone on that edge will either have to be left out, or you'll have to
somehow attempt some zone stacking to get a piece of road in there.</p>

<p>The two-wide strip solves all of these problems.  Each zone is touching
exactly three squares of road on one side.  Corners and intersections are
reduced to almost nothing.  You can build your entire city of strips, with no
connecting streets on the ends of the strips.  Even if you do want to have
connecting streets on the ends (to keep the game more realistic, if you care),
they would be insignificant in number.  The strip layout also allows roads to
be on the "inside" of the pattern; instead of imagining this pattern as two
zone-wide strips, imagine it as two single strips, with a road down the middle.
When repeated, it tends to have the appearance of two zone-wide strips, and in
the middle of a big city, the difference is irrelevant.  But on the edges it's
important.  Having a road up against the edge of the map is a waste; the goal
for any piece of road should be to provide to as many zones as possible.  When
you put a road up against the edge of the map, it becomes incapable of
providing transportation to that edge.  The difference between the two is
probably not huge, but it's one of the many little things that you can do to
tip yourself over the 500k population mark.  Every little thing counts.</p>

<h4>But the strips don't have places for gifts, police, and fire stations!</h4>

<p>Ah, but they do.  Place them wherever you want!  That is a benefit of this
layout.  With donuts, you're pretty much stuck putting these things in the
middle of the donuts.  If for whatever reason, you don't want to put them
there, then you begin to take away land from your zones, and since you can't
put the zones in the middle of the donuts, you end up wasting land.  It's
important to have complete police coverage in a large city, while at the same
time having just as few police stations as you need to get the job done.  The
strip layout leaves the arrangement completely up to you, encouraging
fine-tuning of the police station layout, minimizing any negative effect on
your population density.  Gifts are also just as effective in this layout.
When you place a gift in one of the strips, it raises the land values for the
same pattern of zones around it as it would in a donut - the road on one side
does not have a significant negative impact.</p>

<p>Even assuming you wanted the same number of police, fire, and gifts within a
given area, the strips still are the obvious choice.  Given the layout in the
test, we have nine such open spots in our donut layout.  If we we destroyed
that many zones in our strip layout, we would be at 81 zones - still 9 more
than the donut layout, and still with half of the roads.  We can even do a
pseudo-donut layout within the strips if we want. This image does a good job of
visually comparing the two layouts, and showing you the row of 9 "free" zones
at the bottom:</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/donut-like-strips.png"></p>

<h2>Bare Minimum Transportation</h2>

<p>There is something that you can do no matter how your city is laid out, to
cut costs, pollution, and raise land values:  destroying roads and rails.
Remember how each zone only needs to touch one square of road or rail?  Well,
the game also doesn't care whether any given piece of road touches any other
piece of road (hooray for late eighties technology).  We can get away with
something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/cut-up-roads.png"></p>

<p>I put parks in the blank spaces, but you can put that space to use by
stacking other things in:</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/cut-up-roads-stacked.png"></p>

<h2>Stacking</h2>

<p>Stacking is a bit of a hack which exploits the fact that residential zones
allow you to bulldoze individual houses, before the zone turns into a large
building.  You can then put other buildings in the gap.</p>

<p>You probably already knew that, but you might not know all of the possibile
things you can do by stacking zones.  Temporary residential zones can be used
as sacrificial lambs to shave down other buildings.  The interesting thing is
that the only buildings that do not really benefit from stacking are
residential zones themselves; since they need to develop from little houses
first, they can't ever grow up if some of the individual houses are covered by
something else.  Thus, the only time you should ever employ residential
stacking is when the land would otherwise go unused, such as in the example
directly above.  The house which gets "priority" (is allowed to develop past
little houses) is the one which has more likelyhood to develop into a nicer
property and/or possibly become a top.</p>

<p>So basically anything other than residential zones is a good candidate for
stacking.  Gifts, police stations, fire stations, power plants, stadiums, air
and sea ports, etc.  You can really go off the deep end with stacking and
essentially stack everything to maximum capacity; this is how you get to the
super-high populations (this is how I got to 600,000).</p>

<p>Here are some pictures to show you how to stack, and some neat stuff you can
do with it.</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>Build some residentials, let them grow all of their little houses, but don't
let them form into big buildings</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack1.png"></p>

<p>Now bulldoze some of the little houses to make space.  Don't bulldoze the R!
Turning the speed to paused helps here, so the houses don't spring right back
to life while you're working.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack2.png"></p>

<p>Now put your new zones in place.  They can be anything (notice we can build
parks in here too), but let's do some more residentials.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack3.png"></p>

<p>Maybe I changed my mind and want some commercials.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack4.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack5.png"></p>

<p>But notice that now I can't grow it any more.  You can only stack with
residential zones, so if you want to stack other types of zones, you need to
build temporary residentials, as we did here.  Of course, most of the time you
will do more than just 5 zones, but this was just an example.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack6.png"></p>

<h3>Fitting In</h3>

<p>You need a space of 3x3 to build a zone, but sometimes you have something
close to this, but are blocked by some other zones, and/or are in a tight
space, like on a coastline.  In that case, you can often squeeze in a zone with
stacking.  It's important to make sure that you always route transportation to
them somehow (train/roads over water are just fine, even if only one little
square.  you can build a whole line out there and then bulldoze all but the one
little square you need)</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack7.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack8.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack9.png"></p>

<h3>Stacking: Not Only For Zones</h3>

<p>You can stack pretty much anything.</p>

<p>Let's stack an airport.  Make sure we have everything lined up..</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack10.png"></p>

<p>Let them grow</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack11.png"></p>

<p>We had an akward spot over on the left, so let's get that fixed up</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack12.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack13.png"></p>

<p>Damn, it's annoying when they turn into bigger buildings.  In this case, we
can just wait a minute and it'll flip back, since there's no real city and no
transportation.  In a normal situation, you can cut off the zone's
transportation supply, and it'll slowly shrink back down.  Once it's where you
want it, put the transportation back, and continue where you left off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack14.png"></p>

<p>We really do have enough room!</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack15.png"></p>

<p>And there it is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack16.png"></p>

<p>Make sure the game is paused, and nuke the residentials.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack17.png"></p>

<p>Now we have a mini airport!  It works just the same, too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack18.png"></p>

<h3>The Big Crunch</h3>

<p>Let's really pack some stuff together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack19.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack20.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack21.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack22.png"></p>

<h3>Residential Stacking: Not So Great</h3>

<p>But notice that stacking doesn't work well with residentials.  A few big
buildings appear, but they prevent the other zones from growing past little
houses.  So generally you will only want to leave residential zones stacked
when you're using up otherwise empty space (like our coastline example above).
Otherwise, residentials should only be used as temporaries to get commercial
and industrial zones stacked.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack23.png"></p>

<p>Our industrials have no problem growing in such conditions.  Neither do
commercials.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack24.png"></p>

<h3>Etc.</h3>

<p>Here's a handy use:</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack25.png"></p>

<p>Here's stacking taken to the extreme.  There *is* a pattern here!  This is
the most efficient building pattern I've found so far, but I'm sure I can do a
bit better.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack26.png"></p>

<p>Here's more detail about that zone pattern.  Notice, one little square of
transportation supplies 6 whole zones.  Power lines are unneeded, because zones
aren't seperated from each other -- they're just one huge glob.  You can repeat
this block in at least a couple different patterns, but basically it works out
to something honeycomb-like; that's what's in the picture above.  It's
presented next to some other familiar block patterns to show just how
ridiculously more efficient it is.</p>

<p><img src="/images/simcity/stack28.png"></p>

<p>If you leave air and seaports disconnected from power, they'll still satisfy
your citizens' desire for them.  They'll still pollute, but your seaport won't
launch any boats -- no boat crashes!</p>
