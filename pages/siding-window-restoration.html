<p>My wife and I bought a 1950 house in 2013 that suffered an unfortunate
series of lobotomizations in the 90s. Vinyl windows were installed in
1998&mdash;I found some date labels on them. There's no way to know for sure
when the vinyl siding was put up, but it was likely at that same time. The old
windows and trim were tossed out and the vinyl siding was run right up to the
vinyl windows with no trim except vinyl J-channel. We knew when buying it that
we really needed to do something to the exterior to fix its depressing
demeanor.</p>

<h2>vinyl removal</h2>

<p>We started tearing off vinyl and fanfold (1/4" thick extruded polystyrene
foam that is often installed under vinyl) and found the original grooved cedar
shingles that were in passable shape, in a pretty sweet green-blue color. We
laid down plastic to catch lead paint chips, and vacuumed the siding and the
removed materials with the brush attachment on an EPA RRP certified lead-safe
HEPA vacuum (Vacmaster VK811PH). It's the cheapest certified HEPA vac I could
find and had good reviews on Amazon, and I'm happy with it. Anyone who works on
a pre-1978 house should have a certified HEPA vacuum and use it religiously
when disturbing old paint. There were a lot of spider egg sacs, cobwebs, dust
and various debris on the old siding after years of being covered up. We then
filled nail holes with MH Ready Patch, and encapsulated the lead paint with
Zinsser Peel Stop Triple Thick&mdash;one coat thinned with 10% water, and a
second coat unthinned, followed by Benjamin Moore Regal low lustre. We matched
the color to BM's historic color Mill Springs Blue. With the primer tinted (and
very thick), one coat of paint was all we needed.</p>

<h2>grooved cedar shingles</h2>

<p>The grooved cedar shingles are often mistakenly referred to as shakes, but
they are shingles, not shakes. Shingles are sawn, and thus pretty flat and
square and uniform. Shakes are split, like firewood is split with an axe, and
tend to be chunky and irregular.  The grooves on these shingles are cut by a
machine on one side, and the backside is flat. The Cedar Shake and Shingle
Bureau calls them Certigroove&reg; shingles. Some people call them "raked".
They were apparently considered a somewhat upscale but relatively affordable
siding in the 40s and 50s. No one seems to be using them on new houses these
days, but in the Pacific Northwest they're everywhere on mid century
houses.</p>

</p>

<p>The thing with shingles and shakes is that the material is not necessarily
that expensive, but the small pieces make them labor-intensive to install, and
as labor has gotten a lot more expensive over the last half century, shingles
and shakes have become very expensive to have professionally installed. The
18" pre-primed grooved shingles I found locally were $80 for a carton that covers 50 square
feet. But that 50 square feet is calculated using a 14" reveal. Ours are more
like a 12.5" reveal, so (12.5/14)*50 is 44.6 square feet, which makes these
about $1.80/sqft. The backing shingles, which are low grade #4 18" non-grooved shingles, were about $16 for 100 sqft, so the
total for both layers of shingles is just about $2/sqft.</p>

<p>What's the deal with the second layer of shingles? The more traditional
style of non-grooved cedar shingles and shakes are installed with much shorter
courses, something like 5 to 8 inches. The vertical seams in one layer are
covered up on the layer above it, and the many layers overlapping keep water
out. But these grooved shingles tend to be installed in very tall courses,
10-14" or so, with one course only overlapping the next by a few inches. So, to
keep the water out, they are doubled up. For each course, you first install a
layer of the cheap backing shingles, and then you install the grooved shingles
on top of those, with the vertical seams staggered to prevent any water from
getting all the way back through behind the siding as it runs down the face of
the building.</p>

<h2>how to re-paint old siding with lead paint</h2>

<p>Standard advice for re-painting a house is to scrape and remove any loose
paint. But that's a bad idea with lead paint, and even if it wasn't lead paint,
you can't scrape these grooved shingles -- maybe you could use a wire brush or
something, I don't know. But the lead makes that moot. We did not scrape or
wire brush or anything. In accordance with the Peel Stop Triple Thick
directions, we just painted right over the cracking, peeling old paint. This
primer is like pudding. It dries into a glue-like substance that locks
everything down. The difference in smoothness and uniformity is pretty
incredible, even before paint is put on.</p>

<h2>window flashing, 2015 style</h2>

<p>When the vinyl windows were put in, few provisions were made for potential
water leaks. The J-channel was caulked to the windows, and that was it.  The
windows were shoved into the wood rough openings (some with the old rock
lath/plaster returns still in place) and nailed/screwed in.
If you spend a little time reading about proper window flashing, you will
realize that this is really unwise. What if water gets behind the siding?  What
happens when the caulk eventually cracks or separates? What if the window
itself cracks and leaks? All of these things happen and you should be prepared
for them to happen. The window needs a diaper, which is the sill pan flashing.
I flashed the sill and jambs with flashing membrane. At first I was using Henry
Blue Skin and some random Pella foil-faced flashing tape, which were fine, but
then I found some DuPont FlexWrap for cheap on craigslist and that was so much
better for the sill. It makes the corners of the sill both easier and more
robust -- it just stretches around the corner in one continuous piece. I made
sure to fold up the back of the sill flashing to the interior stool trim,
making a backdam. I did the best I could to integrate new pieces of roofing
felt with the existing, sliding it sideways behind the shingles and old felt.
Vertical seams are hard to seal in an ideal way without tearing off a bunch
more shingles, so I did the best I could within reason. The felt goes on after
the window flashing and laps over it. Everything goes on from bottom to top,
overlapping shingle-style.</p>

<h2>window trim, 1950 style</h2>

<p>With the windows now properly protected, they needed trim. We don't have any
of the original trim to study, but there are a lot of similar houses around the
neighborhood, so we made a very safe guess that the trim was originally a
sloped 2-by sill with brickmould around the sides and top, mitered at the
corners. We decided to steal a feature that only some of these houses have:
window trim that wraps around the corners of the house. It makes sense because
on 3 of 4 corners of our house, we have windows very close to the corner.  And
we thought it looked cool. Our house obviously did not originally have this,
because there were shingles installed where this trim would go.</p>

<p>The window trim goes like this. The sill is a cedar 2x4 ripped with a 10
degree slope to a depth of 1.5". So it's almost like a 2x2, except it's a
parallelogram, not a square. It's 1.5" front to back, and 1.5" top to bottom.
But the parallelogram shape means that you couldn't make it from a 2x2. You'd
at least need a 2x3. I also cut a kerf on the underside to help water drip off.
The jambs and head (sides and top) are standard brickmould, made of
finger-jointed pine, which is 2" wide by 1 1/4" thick (at its thickest part).
The bottom of the jamb has to be cut at a 10 degree angle to match the top of
the sill, and the top of the jamb has to be mitered at 45 degrees. The head has
to be mitered to mate with the jamb, and also mitered in a different axis to
meet with the other head at the corner of the house.</p>

<p>I don't know how the original carpenters went about this, but they must have
been much more efficient than me. For a single window, I would construct the
whole thing like a picture frame and then mount it on the house, but that did
not seem viable for this big awkward three-dimensional structure that has to
wrap around the corner of the house. So I did it piece by piece. It was slow
and frustrating. I have no advice here yet. It sucks. I did glue and either
nail or screw each joint.</p>

<p>The large area in the corner gets covered by panels of 1/2" plywood. To meet
with the rest of the stuff at the appropriate depth, I want it to be about 1"
thick, so that means two layers of 1/2" plywood. Instead of the bottom layer
being a solid sheet, I cut scraps into furring strips. This allowed me to shim
the furring strips for better squareness/plumbness, it used a bit less
material, and it formed a miniature rainscreen which helps keep everything in
that vicinity drier. I did not miter the corner of the plywood panels; I just
butted them and used glue and nails. I used sanded plywood for a nice smooth
painted surface, and sanded/filled the imperfections to make it nice.</p>

    <br><span class="caption">Trim about 2/3 done, with furring strips for corner panels</span>
</p>

<p>After the trim is done and the shingles underneath are in place, a strip
of shingle moulding is put under the sill. It's just a little decorative
touch that some of the houses of the era have, while some do not. The big box
stores only carried PVC versions of this trim, which I don't like, but we found
some in real wood at local stores. Both Woodcrafters and Mr. Plywood in
Portland have it, for a little over a buck a foot. At Woodcrafters it's item
H-440. It seems to only be commonly available in Hemlock, so that's what we
got.</p>

<p>Above the head trim, especially when it's not right under an eave,
it's important to protect it from rain with some metal flashing. The
modern technique you'll see on new houses is a metal drip cap that is very
visible when looking at the house from ground level. I find that pretty ugly
and too function-over-form, so I use a 1.5"x1" metal flashing, with the 1.5"
part running vertically behind the siding (actually, behind the felt), and the
1" part running horizontally over the head casing. I bend it slightly by hand
so it's not quite 90 degrees, and has a slight slope to shed water. I think
this is a good compromise between form and function. Just keep in mind that
your head casing will still be exposed to some direct rainfall on its outer top
corner, and you should expect to keep it painted and in good shape to protect
it. It's literally the roof for the whole window.</p>
