<p>It seems that for years, Firefox (all the way back to plain Mozilla) on Unix/X11
has had a problem with Flash where if you interact with a Flash object on a
page, the whole browser window will just decide to raise itself to the top of
the stack for no reason.  I remember looking for a bug entry for the problem
way back and finding one, but that's about all I remember.  On a whim I thought
of an idea with library preloading and gave it a whirl, and it worked.</p>

<p>Download: <a href="http://incise.org/files/dev/interceptor.c">http://incise.org/files/dev/interceptor.c</a></p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class="sh"><code>$ gcc interceptor.c -o interceptor.so -shared -lX11 -ldl -rdynamic
$ LD_PRELOAD=./interceptor.so
$ export LD_PRELOAD
$ firefox &amp;
(... look at messages if you want to ...)
$ exit</code></pre>

<p>Packages needed (Ubuntu): libx11-dev, gcc, libc-dev</p>

<p>Other distros/BSDs: you basically need gcc and whatever packages will give
you the files Xlib.h and dlfcn.h</p>

<p>The basic idea of how it works is that in X11, windows raise themselves by
calling <code>XRaiseWindow</code>.  We can intercept these calls and
conditionally drop them, causing the window to stay right where it is.  There
are some imperfect heuristics involved which you may need to alter.  It looks
for a window with <code>WM_CLASS</code> of <code>("Gecko",
    "Firefox-bin")</code>, so if you are using Mozilla or any other Gecko
browser besides Firefox, then it will be different.  To check, run <code>xprop
    | grep WM_CLASS</code> and click the cross cursor on your browser window.
This is what you will need to change it to.</p>

<p>It also only blocks <code>XRaiseWindow</code> requests from windows that are
more than 400 pixels wide and tall.  This keeps it from interfering with menus.
A better idea might be to check for <code>override_redirect</code>, or various
window properties... but I'll have to get around to that some other time.  For
now, it won't work if you have a really small browser window, which you
probably don't anyway.</p>

<p>This page is now a number of years old and I don't use Firefox with Flash
much anymore, so it may no longer be an issue.</p>
