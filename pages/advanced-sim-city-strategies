<h2>Intro</h2>

The information on this page applies to the SNES version of Sim City
("Classic," not 2000).  I realize this page is a bit late, considering the game
came out over a decade ago, but I've been playing it on and off since that
point, and have found it odd that all of the info on the net about the game is
pretty rudimentary and basic, barely going beyond what's in the manual.

The purpose of this page is to cover some of the various strategies that can be
used to build cities with huge populations.  The largest city I have personally
built was a little over 650,000.  However, I should mention that I haven't
built a large number of large cities, because I did the majority of my playing
when I was a kid.  In recent years, I've come back to the game a few times,
learning new things each time that I didn't know back in the day, and building
bigger cities each time.

<h2>Some Basics</h2>

<h3>Destroy Schools and Hospitals</h3>

They don't add to the population, so nuke them.

<h3>One Firestation</h3>

Fire coverage is a waste of time and space.  Build one fire station to shut the
people up, but don't build any more.  At some point you might want to build
six, twelve, or eighteen fire stations, to get your HQs.  Once you build at
least one of the HQs, destroy your regular fire station.

So if your fire coverage sucks, how do you fight a fire?  Easy.  When a fire
breaks out, turn the time to stopped, get to the scene of the fire, bulldoze
anything around it that you can easily rebuild, build a few firestations around
it, turn the time back on, and wait for it to go out.  Then destroy your
temporary fire stations and rebuild.

<h3>Optimal Transportation</h3>

Most importantly, don't use roads.  Pollution and traffic suck.

Secondly, if you getting the highest population is the goal, then you must use as
few rails as possible (I'll get into that more, in a bit).  Each zone only needs one square
of rail touching it, and any unneeded squares should be replaced with parks -- or, even
better -- used to stack in some extra zones.

And to truly milk your land, always try to use water for transportation.  Remember:
you can build rails on water, but not buildings.  So whenever you're near the coastline,
try to pack in as many zones as possible, and stick your transportation in the water.

<h2>The Best Maps</h2>

Each map is 120x100.

Generally you want less water, since obviously you can't build anything on
water.  But water isn't completely worthless: it significantly raises the land
value of the land surrounding it.  Since industrial zones don't really care
about land value, try and cover most or all of your waterfront with
residentials and commercials.

There is also the freedom map -- the one with the big mario face forest in the
center, and no water -- but you don't get any presents on that map, which makes
it much less useful than it seems at first.

The following is a list of the best maps I know of, ordered by their amount of
water (less water is better):

<tr><td><strong>map #</strong></td><td><strong>water</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>61      </td><td> 1740</td></tr>
<tr><td>728     </td><td> 1830</td></tr>
<tr><td>849     </td><td> 1941</td></tr>
<tr><td>31      </td><td> 2071</td></tr>
<tr><td>714     </td><td> 2134</td></tr>
<tr><td>921     </td><td> 2153</td></tr>
<tr><td>default </td><td> 2197</td></tr>

<h2>The Money Trick</h2>

You can easily find this on google but I'll try to sum it up as concisely as
possible:

 1. set fire/police/transportation funding levels to 0%
 1. build something that has an annual tax cost -- fire/police dept., road, or rail.  one is enough.
 1. spend all of your money
 1. make sure you have auto-$ off, and wait until the tax screen pops up
 1. press and hold L -- don't let go!
 1. exit the tax screen, and then immediately re-access it via the menu
 1. raise all funding levels to 100%, exit tax screen
 1. let go of L

The morality of using this trick is debatable, but personally I think it's
fine.  Trying to actually build a city the expected way is really slow, and a
total pain in the ass.  There are other ways to jack up your cash, like
reaching profitabiliy and then leaving the game running for a few days.  I
wouldn't really call that cheating either, and I just look at the money trick
as a faster method.  Fighting economics and taxes is boring to me - getting the
highest population is a more exciting challenge to focus on.  And that is what
Sim City is all about, right?  Making your own goals?

<h2>Easy Pausing</h2>

The L and R buttons pause the game.  This is how the money trick works, and it
is also extremely useful when stacking zones -- you can prevent little houses
from growing back while you're trying to bulldoze and build things.

<h2>The Startup Bug</h2>

<a href="http://home.twcny.rr.com/petersplace/supernes.htm">Here</a> is another page with a
couple useful bits -- most notably a fix for the "startup bug."  This refers to
how for the first few moments after loading a city, the power is out, crime is
extremely high, etc.  The fix is to immediately set the speed to paused, wait a
minute (maybe even just 10, 20, 30 seconds or so -- I didn't test it
extensively), and then resume.

I disagree with a thing or two on that page (big cities should have more
industrials than commercials, not vice versa -- and donuts suck), but the gifts
list is also quite useful.  I was going to put one on this page sometime, but
never got around to it.

<h2>Debunkin' Donuts</h2>

The donut block is widely considered to be the best arrangement for zones, but
in my opinion it definitely is not.  The two zone-wide strips have always
seemed more dense to me, and to find out the truth, I've done a test.  But
before I get to that, I should explain the various conditions that a block
arrangement needs to meet:

 <li>Each zone needs transportation; this means directly touching at least one</li>
 square of road or railroad.
 <li>A block needs to be some sort of shape that is repeatable, usually a square</li>
 or rectangle.  The idea is to take the best block arrangement and repeat it
 over the whole map, to use space in the most efficient manner possible.
 <li>A block should try to minimize the amount of land used by road or railroad,</li>
 thereby raising the density of the zones contained in the block, and lowing
 transportation upkeep costs.

Now, what do these two arrangements look like?  The donut is a 9x9 square of
zones, with the middle zone cut out and usually used for a police department,
fire department, or gift.  The donut layout is said to maximize the land
value-raising effects of gifts, and provide a straightforward place to put
police and fire departments, since their effectiveness is the same regardless
of the transportation available to them.

The two zone-wide strip is simply that: a strip of zones, two wide, and of any
length.  Longer strips are preferable, as they minimize the space taken by
roads and rails.

<h3>The Test</h3>

So as mentioned, I decided to conduct a somewhat scientific test between the
efficiency of these two layouts.  I decided to give the donut blocks the
advantage by fitting the test area to them, and then filling the same area with
strips.  The area was 31x31 squares, which means 3x3 donut blocks, or 9 strips.

<h4>Donut Results</h4>

<img src="/images/simcity/donut-density.png">

<tr><td></td><td>Statistics</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of zones</td><td>72</td></tr>
<tr><td>Amount of rails/roads</td><td>23.2km</td></tr>

<h4>Strip Results</h4>

<img src="/images/simcity/strip-density.png">

<tr><td></td><td>Statistics</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number of zones</td><td>90</td></tr>
<tr><td>Amount of rails/roads</td><td>12.0km</td></tr>

It now becomes quite clear that the donut layout wastes a considerable
amount of space on roads.  In fact, if we examine the layout, we can find
that each corner block is completely covered in roads on two sides.  That's
six times more than we need on those zones!  The roads on the corners also go
to waste, as they aren't even touching any zones.  These are low in number
enough to not be a big concern, but they're still wasteful.  The third
problem regarding their use of roads is the fact that each block needs to be
surrounded by roads.  Ideally, roads belong on the inside edge of any
pattern, not the outside.  Putting them on the outside is the entire reason
we have so much of them, but the donut layout doesn't leave us with much
other choice.  This also causes problems when you reach the end of the map
and are one block short; the center zone on that edge will either have to be
left out, or you'll have to somehow attempt some zone stacking to get a piece
of road in there.

The two-wide strip solves all of these problems.  Each zone is touching
exactly three squares of road on one side.  Corners and intersections are
reduced to almost nothing.  You can build your entire city of strips, with no
connecting streets on the ends of the strips.  Even if you do want to have
connecting streets on the ends (to keep the game more realistic, if you
care), they would be insignificant in number.  The strip layout also allows
roads to be on the "inside" of the pattern; instead of imagining this pattern
as two zone-wide strips, imagine it as two single strips, with a road down
the middle.  When repeated, it tends to have the appearance of two zone-wide
strips, and in the middle of a big city, the difference is irrelevant.  But
on the edges it's important.  Having a road up against the edge of the map is
a waste; the goal for any piece of road should be to provide to as many zones
as possible.  When you put a road up against the edge of the map, it becomes
incapable of providing transportation to that edge.  The difference between
the two is probably not huge, but it's one of the many little things that you
can do to tip yourself over the 500k population mark.  Every little thing
counts.

<h4>But the strips don't have places for gifts, police, and fire stations!</h4>

Ah, but they do.  Place them wherever you want!  That is a benefit of this
layout.  With donuts, you're pretty much stuck putting these things in the
middle of the donuts.  If for whatever reason, you don't want to put them
there, then you begin to take away land from your zones, and since you can't
put the zones in the middle of the donuts, you end up wasting land.  It's
important to have complete police coverage in a large city, while at the same
time having just as few police stations as you need to get the job done.  The
strip layout leaves the arrangement completely up to you, encouraging
fine-tuning of the police station layout, minimizing any negative effect on
your population density.  Gifts are also just as effective in this layout.
When you place a gift in one of the strips, it raises the land values for the
same pattern of zones around it as it would in a donut - the road on one side
does not have a significant negative impact.

Even assuming you wanted the same number of police, fire, and gifts within
a given area, the strips still are the obvious choice.  Given the layout in
the test, we have nine such open spots in our donut layout.  If we we
destroyed that many zones in our strip layout, we would be at 81 zones -
still 9 more than the donut layout, and still with half of the roads.  We can
even do a pseudo-donut layout within the strips if we want. This image does a
good job of visually comparing the two layouts, and showing you the row of 9
"free" zones at the bottom:

<h2>Bare Minimum Transportation</h2>

There is something that you can do no matter how your city is laid out, to
cut costs, pollution, and raise land values:  destroying roads and rails.
Remember how each zone only needs to touch one square of road or rail?  Well,
the game also doesn't care whether any given piece of road touches any other
piece of road (hooray for late eighties technology).  We can get away with
something like this:

<img src="/images/simcity/cut-up-roads.png">

I put parks in the blank spaces, but you can put that space to use by
stacking other things in:

<img src="/images/simcity/cut-up-roads-stacked.png">

<h2>Stacking</h2>

Stacking is a bit of a hack which exploits the fact that residential zones
allow you to bulldoze individual houses, before the zone turns into a large
building.  You can then put other buildings in the gap.

You probably already knew that, but you might not know all of the
possibile things you can do by stacking zones.  Temporary residential zones
can be used as sacrificial lambs to shave down other buildings.  The
interesting thing is that the only buildings that do not really benefit from
stacking are residential zones themselves; since they need to develop from
little houses first, they can't ever grow up if some of the individual houses
are covered by something else.  Thus, the only time you should ever employ
residential stacking is when the land would otherwise go unused, such as in
the example directly above.  The house which gets "priority" (is allowed to
develop past little houses) is the one which has more likelyhood to develop
into a nicer property and/or possibly become a top.

So basically anything other than residential zones is a good candidate for
stacking.  Gifts, police stations, fire stations, power plants, stadiums, air
and sea ports, etc.  You can really go off the deep end with stacking and
essentially stack everything to maximum capacity; this is how you get to the
super-high populations (this is how I got to 600,000).

Here are some pictures to show you how to stack, and
some neat stuff you can do with it.

<h3>The Basics</h3>

Build some residentials, let them grow all of their little houses, but
don't let them form into big buildings

<img src="/images/simcity/stack1.png">

Now bulldoze some of the little houses to make space.  Don't bulldoze the
R!  Turning the speed to paused helps here, so the houses don't spring right
back to life while you're working.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack2.png">

Now put your new zones in place.  They can be anything (notice we can build
parks in here too), but let's do some more residentials.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack3.png">

Maybe I changed my mind and want some commercials.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack4.png">

<img src="/images/simcity/stack5.png">

But notice that now I can't grow it any more.  You can only stack with
residential zones, so if you want to stack other types of zones, you need to
build temporary residentials, as we did here.  Of course, most of the time
you will do more than just 5 zones, but this was just an example.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack6.png">

<h3>Fitting In</h3>

You need a space of 3x3 to build a zone, but sometimes you have something
close to this, but are blocked by some other zones, and/or are in a tight
space, like on a coastline.  In that case, you can often squeeze in a zone
with stacking.  It's important to make sure that you always route
transportation to them somehow (train/roads over water are just fine, even if
only one little square.  you can build a whole line out there and then
bulldoze all but the one little square you need)

<img src="/images/simcity/stack7.png">

<h3>Stacking: Not Only For Zones</h3>

You can stack pretty much anything.

Let's stack an airport.  Make sure we have everything lined up..

<img src="/images/simcity/stack10.png">

Let them grow

<img src="/images/simcity/stack11.png">

We had an akward spot over on the left, so let's get that fixed up

<img src="/images/simcity/stack12.png">

<img src="/images/simcity/stack13.png">

Damn, it's annoying when they turn into bigger buildings.  In this case,
we can just wait a minute and it'll flip back, since there's no real city
and no transportation.  In a normal situation, you can cut off the zone's
transportation supply, and it'll slowly shrink back down.  Once it's where
you want it, put the transportation back, and continue where you left
off.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack14.png">

We really do have enough room!

<img src="/images/simcity/stack15.png">

And there it is.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack16.png">

Make sure the game is paused, and nuke the residentials.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack17.png">

Now we have a mini airport!  It works just the same, too.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack18.png">

<h3>The Big Crunch</h3>

Let's really pack some stuff together.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack19.png">

<img src="/images/simcity/stack20.png">

<img src="/images/simcity/stack21.png">

<img src="/images/simcity/stack22.png">

<h3>Residential Stacking: Not So Great</h3>

But notice that stacking doesn't work well with residentials.  A few big
buildings appear, but they prevent the other zones from growing past little
houses.  So generally you will only want to leave residential zones stacked
when you're using up otherwise empty space (like our coastline example
above).  Otherwise, residentials should only be used as temporaries to get
commercial and industrial zones stacked.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack23.png">

Our industrials have no problem growing in such conditions.  Neither do
commercials.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack24.png">

<h3>Etc.</h3>

Here's a handy use:

<img src="/images/simcity/stack25.png">

Here's stacking taken to the extreme.  There *is* a pattern here!  This is the
most efficient building pattern I've found so far, but I'm sure I can do a bit
better.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack26.png">

Here's more detail about that zone pattern.  Notice, one little square of
transportation supplies 6 whole zones.  Power lines are unneeded, because zones
aren't seperated from each other -- they're just one huge glob.  You can repeat
this block in at least a couple different patterns, but basically it works out
to something honeycomb-like; that's what's in the picture above.  It's
presented next to some other familiar block patterns to show just how
ridiculously more efficient it is.

<img src="/images/simcity/stack28.png">

If you leave air and seaports disconnected from power, they'll still
satisfy your citizens' desire for them.  They'll still pollute, but your
seaport won't launch any boats -- no boat crashes!
