this is the product of a crazy idea i had one day for generating gradients, in
html (with php, since that's all i really knew anyway).  the idea seemed so
cool at the time, and the results are pretty awesome looking, if i do say so
myself.  the files are numbered in order of my progress:  it started off super
simple and progressed from there.
